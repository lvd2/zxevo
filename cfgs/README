--==<<Configuration directory structure>>==--



DIR: pentevo/cfgs/<name>/<branch>/*

"cfgs" directory is intended to contain complete configuration build for the
ZxEvo: avr binaries, fpga binaries, ROM binaries, build scripts, etc.

Currently it is assumed that the user (=the person willing to compile a
configuration) re-fetches parts of configuration (avr source code tree, fpga
source code tree, etc.) to the above DIR manually. One might create/update a
script for that, but the point is to keep avr/fpga/etc. source code trees apart
from configuration source code tree, which allows one to cherrypick particular
avr, fpga, ROM, etc. sources to the given configuration. Particular example is
to be able to build using different and uncorrelated branches of each component.

<name> should be, obviously, a configuration name.

<branch> is branch/tag name, mostly it would be just "trunk", but feel free to
create your own branches whenever you feel it is appropriate.

As an example, take "baseconf_standalone". There's a build script that assumes
you already fetched appropriate avr and fpga source trees inside the directory
where that build script is situated.

That "make.sh" build script is not a Makefile, since Makefiles mostly useful
when there are lots of sources and build process is unlikely to be iterated
completely when just some files are changed. Here we need, basically, just to
visit avr and fpga trees and initiate their builds, if there is need to.

It is assumed that you change that "make.sh" script for yourself (but don't
commit changes) as you might use different tools versions, tools might be placed
under different paths, you might use miserable platforms such as Шindoшs, etc.



DIR: pentevo/avr/<avr-related-name>/<branch>/* 

These is avr sources that might be used in one of configurations.



DIR: pentevo/fpga/<fpga-related-name>/<branch>/* 

Same for FPGA.



DIR: pentevo/rom/*

Currently not in pentevo/rom/<name>/<branch>/* structure. This is TODO.
