This instruction is meant for those people who are already very
familiar with Assembler and who like to know how to work with AS. It
is rather a reference than a user's manual and so it neither tries to
explain the ''language assembler'' nor the processors. I have listed
further literature in the bibliography which was substantial in the
implementation of the different code generators. There is no book I
know where you can learn Assembler from the start, so I generally
learned this by ''trial and error''.

The switch to a different code generator is allowed even within one
file, and as often as one wants!
<P>
The reason for this flexibility is that AS has a history, which may
also be recognized by looking at the version number. AS was created
as an extension of a macro assembler for the 68000 family. On special
request, I extended the original assembler so that it was able to
translate 8051 mnemonics. On this way (decline ?!) from the 68000 to
8051, some other processors were created as by-products. All others
were added over time due to user requests. So At least for the
processor-independent core of AS, one may assume that it is
well-tested and free of obvious bugs. However, I often do not have
the chance to test a new code generator in practice (due to lack of
appropriate hardware), so surprises are not impossible when working
with new features. You see, the things stated in section <A
HREF="#ref_SectLicense">1.1</A> have a reason...
<P>
This flexibility implies a somewhat exotic code format, therefore I
added some tools to work with it. Their description can be found in
chapter <A HREF="#ref_ChapTools">6</A>.
<P>
AS is a macro assembler, which means that the programmer has the
possibility to define new ''commands'' by means of macros.
Additionally it masters conditional assembling. Labels inside macros
are automatically processed as being local.
<P>
For the assembler, symbols may have either integer, string or
floating point values. These will be stored - like interim values in
formulas - with a width of 32 bits for integer values, 80 or 64 bits
for floating point values, and 255 characters for strings. For a
couple of micro controllers, there is the possibility to classify
symbols by segmentation. So the assembler has a (limited) possibility
to recognize accesses to wrong address spaces.
<P>
The assembler does not know explicit limits in the nesting depth of
include files or macros; a limit is only given by the program stack
restricting the recursion depth. Nor is there a limit for the symbol
length, which is only restricted by the maximum line length.
<P>
From version 1.38 on, AS is a multipass-assembler. This pompous term
means no more than the fact that the number of passes through the
source code need not be exactly two. If the source code does not
contain any forward references, AS needs only one pass. In case AS
recognizes in the second pass that it must use a shorter or longer
instruction coding, it needs a third (fourth, fifth...) pass to
process all symbol references correctly. There is nothing more behind
the term ''multipass'', so it will not be used further more in this
documentation.
<P>
After so much praise a bitter pill: AS cannot generate linkable code.
An extension with a linker needs considerable effort and is not
planned at the moment.
<P>
Those who want to take a look at the sources of AS can simply get the
Unix version of AS, which comes as source for self-compiling. The
sources are definitely not in a format that is targeted at easy
understanding - the original Pascal version still raises its head at
a couple of places, and I do not share a couple of common opinions
about 'good' C coding.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_1_3_">1.3. Supported Platforms</A></H2>
<P>
Though AS started as a pure DOS program, there are a couple of           
versions available that are able to exploit a bit more than the Real
Mode of an Intel CPU. Their usage is kept as compatible to the DOS
version as possible, but there are of course differences concerning
installation and embedding into the operating system in question.
Sections in this manual that are only valid for a specific version of
AS are marked with a corresponding sidemark (at this paragraph for
the DOS version) aheaded to the paragraph. In detail, the following
further versions exist (distributed as separate packages):
<P>
In case you runinto memory problems when assembling large and complex    
programs under DOS, there is a DOS version that runs in protected
mode via a DOS extender and can therefore make use of the whole
extended memory of an AT. The assembly becomes significantly slower
by the extender, but at least it works...
<P>
There is a native OS/2 version of AS for friends of IBM's OS/2           
operating system. Since version 1.41r8, this is a full 32-bit OS/2
application, which of course means that OS/2 2.x and at least an
80386 CPU are mandatory.
<P>
You can leave the area of PCs-only with the C version of AS that was     
designed to be compilable on a large number of UNIX systems (this
includes OS/2 with the emx compiler) without too much of tweaking. In
contrast to the previously mentioned versions, the C version is
delivered in source code, i.e. one has to create the binaries by
oneself using a C compiler. This is by far the simpler way (for me)
than providing a dozen of precompiled binaries for machines I
sometimes only have limited access to...
<P>
People who have read this enumeration up to this point will notice       
that world's best-selling operating system coming from Redmont is
missing in this enumeration. People who know me personally will know
that I do not regard Windows to be a pat solution (regardless if its
3.X, 95, or NT). Frankly said, I am a 'windows hater'. A large number
of people will now regard this to be somewhere between obsolete and
ridiculous, and they will tell me that I withhold AS from a large
part of potential users, but they will have to live with it: I
primarily continue to improve AS because I have fun doing it; AS is a
non-commercial project and I therefore take the freedom not to look
at potential market shares. I select platforms for me where I have
fun programming, and I definitely do not have any fun when
programming for Windows! By the way, there was a time when I had to
write Windows programs so I do not simply jabber without having an
idea what I am talking about. If someone wants to port AS into this
direction, I will not stand in his way, but (s)he should not expect
anything more from me than providing sources (which is why (s)he will
have to deal with questions like 'why does AS not work any more after
I changed the JUNK-CAD 18.53 registry entry from upper to lower
case?').

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_1_">2.1. Hardware Requirements</A></H2>
<P>
The hardware requirements of AS vary substantially from version to
version:
<P>
The DOS version will principally run on any IBM-compatible PC,           
ranging from a PC/XT with 4-dot-little megahertz up to a Pentium.
However, similar to other programs, the fun using AS increases the
better your hardware is. An XT user without a hard drive will
probably have significant trouble placing the overlay file on a
floppy because it is larger than 500 Kbytes...the PC should therefore
have at least a hard drive, allowing acceptable loading times. AS is
not very advanced in its main memory needs: the program itself
allocates less than 300 Kbytes main memory, AS should therefore work
on machines with at least 512 Kbytes of memory.
<P>
The version of AS compiled for the DOS Protected Mode Interface          
(DPMI) requires at least 1 Mbyte of free extended memory. A total
memory capacity of at least 2 Mbytes is therefore the absolute
minimum given one does not have other tools in the XMS (like disk
caches, RAM disks, or a hi-loaded DOS); the needs will rise then
appropriately. If one uses the DPMI version in a DOS box of OS/2, one
has to assure that DPMI has been enabled via the box's DOS settings
(set to<TT> on</TT> or<TT> auto</TT>) and that a sufficient amount of
XMS memory has been assigned to the box. The virtual memory
management of OS/2 will free you from thinking about the amount of
free real memory.
<P>
The hardware requirements of the OS/2 version mainly result from the     
needs of the underlying operating system, i.e. at minimum an 80386SX
processor, 8 Mbytes of RAM (resp. 4 Mbytes without the graphical user
interface) and 100..150 Mbytes of hard disk space. AS2 is only a
16-bit application and therefore it should also work on older OS/2
versions (thereby reducing the processor needs to at least an 80286
processor); I had however no chance to test this.
<P>
The C version of AS is delivered as source code and therefore            
requires a UNIX or OS/2 system equipped with a C compiler. The
compiler has to fulfill the ANSI standard (GNU-C for example is
ANSI-compliant). You can look up in the<TT> README</TT> file whether
your UNIX system has already been tested so that the necessary
definitions have been made. You should reserve about 15 Mbytes of
free hard disk space for compilation; this value (and the amount
needed after compilation to store the compiled programs) strongly
differs from system to system, so you should take this value only as
a rough approximation.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_2_">2.2. Delivery</A></H2>
<P>
Principally, you can obtain AS in one of two forms: as a<EM>
binary</EM> or a<EM> source</EM> distribution. In case of a binary
distribution, one gets AS, the accomanying tools and auxiliary files
readily compiled, so you can immediately start to use it after
unpacking the archive to the desired destination on your hard drive.
Binary distibutions are made for widespread platforms, where either
the majority of users does not have a compiler or the compilation is
tricky (currently, this includes DOS and OS/2). A source distribution
in contrast contains the complete set of C sources to generate AS; it
is ultimately a snapshot of the source tree I use for development on
AS. The generation of AS from the sources and their structure is
described in detail in appendix <A HREF="#ref_ChapSource">I</A>,
which is why at this place, only the contents and installation of a
binary distribution will be described:
<P>
The contents of the archive is separated into several subdirectories,
therefore you get a directory subtree immediately after unpacking
without having to sort out things manually. The individual
directories contain the following groups of files:
<UL>
<LI> <TT> BIN</TT>: executable programs, text resources;</LI>
<LI> <TT> INCLUDE</TT>: include files for assembler programs, e.g.
    register definitions or standard macros;</LI>
<LI> <TT> MAN</TT>: quick references for the individual programs in Unix
    'man' format.</LI>
</UL>
A list of the files found in every binary distribution is given in
tables <A HREF="#ref_TabCommonPackageList1">2.1</A> to <A
HREF="#ref_TabCommonPackageList3">2.3</A>. In case a file listed in
one of these (or the following) tables is missing, someone took a nap
during copying (probably me)...

Depending on the platform, a binary distribution however may contain
more files to allow operation, like files necessary for DOS
extenders. In case of the DOS DPMI version, the extensions listed in     
table <A HREF="#ref_TabDPMIPackageList">2.4</A> result. Just to
mention it: it is perfectly O.K. to replace the tools with their
counterparts from a DOS binary distribution; on the on hand, they
execute significantly faster without the extender's overhead, and on
the other hand, they do not need the extended memory provided by the
extender.

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_3_">2.3. Installation</A></H2>
<P>
There is no need for a special installation prior to usage of AS. It     
is sufficient to unpack the archive in a fitting place and to add a
few minor settings. For example, this is an installation a user used
to UNIX-like operating systems might choose:
<P>
Create a directory c:\as an (I will assume in the following that you
are going to install AS on drive C), change to this directory and
unpack the archiv, keeping the path names stored in the archive (when
using PKUNZIP, the command line option -d is necessary for that). You
now should have the following directory tree:
<PRE>

c:\as
c:\as\bin
c:\as\include
c:\as\lib
c:\as\man
c:\as\doc
c:\as\demos

</PRE>
Now, append the directory c:\as\bin to the<TT> PATH</TT> statement in
your<TT> AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT>, which allows the system to find AS and
its tools. With your favourite text editor, create a file named<TT>
AS.RC</TT> in the<TT> lib</TT> directory with the following contents:
<PRE>

-i c:\as\include

</PRE>
This so-called<EM> key file</EM> tells AS where to search for its
include files. The following statement must be added to your<TT>
AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> to tell AS to read this file:
<PRE>

set ASCMD=@c:\as\lib\as.rc

</PRE>
There are many more things you can preset via the key file; they are
listed in the following section.
<P>
The installation of the DPMI version should principally take the same    
course as for the pure DOS version; as soon as the PATH contains
the<TT> bin</TT> directory, the DOS extender's files will be found
automatically and you should not notice anything of this mechanism
(except for the longer startup time...). When working on an
80286-based computer, it is theoretically possible tha you get
confronted with the following message upon the first start:
<PRE>

  machine not in database (run DPMIINST)

</PRE>
Since the DPMIINST tool ins not any more included in newer versions
of Borland's DOS extender, I suppose that this is not an item any
more...in case you run into this, contact me!
<P>
The installation of the OS/2 version can generally be done just like     
for the DOS version, with the addition that the DLLs have to be made
visible for the operating system. In case you do not want to extend
the<TT> LIBPATH</TT> entry in your<TT> CONFIG.SYS</TT>, it is of
course also valid to move the DLLs into a directory already listed
in<TT> LIBPATH</TT>.
<P>
As already mentioned, the installation instructions in this section
limit themselves to binary distributions. Since an installation under
Unix is currently alway a source-based installation, the only hint I     
can give here is a reference to appendix <A
HREF="#ref_ChapSource">I</A>.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_4_">2.4. Start-Up Command, Parameters</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_SectCallConvention"></A>
<P>
AS is a command line driven program, i.e. all parameters and file
options are to be given in the command line.
<P>
A couple of message files belongs to AS (recognizable by their
suffix<TT> MSG</TT>) AS accesses to dynamically load the messages
appropriate for the national language. AS searches the following
directories for these files:
<UL>
<LI> the current directory;</LI>
<LI> the EXE-file's directory;</LI>
<LI> the directory named in the<TT> AS_MSGPATH</TT> environment variable,
    or alternitavely the directories listed in the<TT> PATH</TT>
    environment variable;</LI>
<LI> the directory compiled into AS via the<TT> LIBDIR</TT> macro.</LI>
</UL>
These files are<EM> indispensable</EM> for a proper operation of AS,
i.e. AS will terminate immediately if these files are not found.
<P>
The language selection (currently only German and English) is based
on the<TT> COUNTRY</TT> setting under DOS and OS/2 respectively on
the<TT> LANG</TT> environment variable under Unix.
<P>
In order to fulfill AS's memory requirements under DOS, the various      
code generator modules of the DOS version were moved into an overlay
which is part of the EXE file. A separate OVR file like in earlier
versions of AS therefore dose not exist any more, AS will however
still attempt to reduce the overlaying delays by using eventually
available EMS or XMS memory. In case this results in trouble, you may
suppress usage of EMS or XMS by setting the environment variable<TT>
USEXMS</TT> or<TT> USEEMS</TT> to<TT> n</TT>. E.g., it is possible to
suppress the using of XMS by the command:
<PRE>

   SET USEXMS=n

</PRE>
Since AS performs all in- and output via the operating system (and
therefore it should run also on not 100% compatible DOS-PC's) and
needs some basic display control, it emits ANSI control sequences
during the assembly. In case you should see strange characters in the    
messages displayed by AS, your<TT> CONFIG.SYS</TT> is obviously
lacking a line like this:
<PRE>

   device=ansi.sys 

</PRE>
but the further functions of AS will not be influenced hereby.           
Alternatively you are able to suppress the output of ANSI sequences
completely by setting the environment variable<TT> USEANSI</TT>
to<TT> n</TT>.
<P>
The DOS extender of the DPMI version can be influenced in its memory     
allocation strategies by a couple of environment variables; if you
need to know their settings, you may look up them in the file<TT>
DPMIUSER.DOC</TT>. ASX is additionally able to extend the available
memory by a swap file. To do this, set up an environment variable<TT>
ASXSWAP</TT> in the following way:
<PRE>

  SET ASXSWAP=&lt;size&gt;[,file name]

</PRE>
The size specification has to be done in megabytes and<B> has</B> to
be done. The file name in contrast is optional; if it is missing, the
file is named<TT> ASX.TMP</TT> and placed in the current directory.
In any case, the swap file is deleted after program end.
<P>
The command line parameters can roughly be divided into three
categories: switches, key file references (see below) and file
specifications. Parameters of these two categories may be arbitrarily
mixed in the command line. The assembler evaluates at first all
parameters and then assembles the specified files. From this follow
two things:
<UL>
<LI> the specified switches affect all specified source files. If several
    source files shall be assembled with different switches, this has
    to be done in separate runs.</LI>
<LI> it is possible to assemble more than one file in one shot and to
    bring it to the top, it is allowed that the file specs contain
    wildcards.</LI>
</UL>
Parameter switches are recognized by AS by starting with a slash (/)
or hyphen (-). There are switches that are only one character long
and additionally switches composed of a whole word. Whenever AS
cannot interpret a switch as a whole word, it tries to interprete
every letter as an individual switch. For example, if you write
<PRE>

 -queit

</PRE>
instead of
<PRE>

 -quiet

</PRE>
AS will take the letters<TT> q, u, e, i</TT>, and<TT> t</TT> as
individual switches. Multiple-letter switches additionally have the
difference to single-letter switches that AS will accept an arbitrary
mixture of upper and lower casing, whereas single-letter switches may
have a different meaning depending on whether upper or lower case is
used.
<P>
At the moment, the following switches are defined:<A
NAME="index_SHARED_1"></A>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>l</TT>: sends assembler listing to console terminal (mostly
    screen). In case several passes have to be done, the listing of
    all passes will be send to the console (in opposite to the next
    option).</LI>
<LI> <TT>L</TT>: writes assembler listing into a file. The list file will
    get the same name as the source file, only the extension is
    replaced by<TT> LST</TT>. Except one uses...</LI>
<LI> <TT>OLIST</TT>: with a fiel name as argument allows to redirect the
    listing to a different file or a different path. This option may
    be used multiple times in case multiple files are assembled with
    one execution.</LI>
<LI> <TT>o</TT>: Sets the new name of the code file generated by AS. If
    this option is used multiple times, the names will be assigned,
    one after the other, to the source files which have to be
    assembled. A negation (see below) of this option in connection
    with a name erases this name from the list. A negation without a
    name erases the whole list.</LI>
<LI> <TT>SHAREOUT</TT>:ditto for a SHARE file eventually to be
    created.</LI>
<LI> <TT>c</TT>: SHARED-variables will be written in a format which
    permits an easy integration into a C-source file. The extension
    of the file is<TT> H</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>p</TT>: SHARED-variables will be written in a format which
    permits easy integration into the CONST-block of a Pascal
    program. The extension of the file is<TT> INC</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>a</TT>: SHARED-variables will be written in a format which
    permits easy integration into an assembler source file. The
    extension of the file is<TT> INC</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
Concerning effect and function of the SHARED-symbols please see
chapters <A HREF="#ref_ChapShareMain">2.13</A> resp. <A
HREF="#ref_ChapShareOrder">3.9.1</A>.
<UL>
<LI> <TT>g [format]</TT>: This switch instructs AS to create an
    additional file that contains debug information for the program.
    Allowed formats are the AS-specific MAP format (<TT>
    format=MAP</TT>), a NoICE-compatible command file (<TT>
    format=NOICE</TT>), and the Atmel format used by the AVR tools
    (<TT> format=ATMEL</TT>). The information stored in the MAP
    format is comprised of a symbol table and a table describing the
    assignment of source lines to machine addresses. A more detailed
    description of the MAP format can be found in section <A
    HREF="#ref_SectDebugFormat">5.2</A> The file's extension is<TT>
    MAP</TT>,<TT> NOI</TT>, resp.<TT> OBJ</TT>, depending on the
    chosen format. If no explicit format specification is done, the
    MAP format is chosen.</LI>
<LI> <TT>noicemask [value]</TT>: By default, AS lists only symbols from
    the CODE segment in NoICE debug info files. With this option and
    an integer value interpreted as a bit mask, symbols fom other
    segments may be added. The assignment of segments to bit
    positions may be taken from table <A
    HREF="#ref_TabSegmentNums">5.3</A>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>w</TT>: suppress issue of warnings;</LI>
<LI> <TT>E [file]</TT>: error messages and warnings produced by AS will
    be redirected to a file. Instead of a file, the 5 standard
    handles (STDIN..STDPRN) can also be specified as<TT> !0</TT>
    to<TT> !4</TT> . Default is<TT> !2</TT>, meaning STDERR. If the
    file option is left out, the name of the error file is the same
    as of the source file, but with the extension<TT> LOG</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>q</TT>: This switch suppresses all messages of AS, the
    exceptions are error messages and outputs which are are forced
    from the source file. The time needed for assembly is slightly
    reduced hereby and if you call AS from a shell there is no
    redirection required. The disadvantage is that you may ''stay in
    the dark'' for several minutes ... It is valid to write<TT>
    quiet</TT> instead of<TT> q</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>h</TT>: write hexadecimal numbers in lowercase instead of
    capital letters. This option is primarily a question of personal
    taste.</LI>
<LI> <TT>i &lt;path list&gt;</TT>: issues a list of directories where the
    assembler shall automatically search for include files, in case
    it didn't find a file in the current directory. The different
    directories have to be separated by semicolons.</LI>
<LI> <TT>u</TT>: calculate a list of areas which are occupied in the
    segments. This option is effective only in case a listing is
    produced. This option requires considerable additional memory and
    computing performance. In normal operation it should be switched
    off.</LI>
<LI> <TT>C</TT>: generates a list of cross references. It lists which
    (global) symbols are used in files and lines. This list will also
    be generated only in case a listing is produced. This option
    occupies, too, additional memory capacity during assembly.</LI>
<LI> <TT>s</TT>: issues a list of all sections (see chapter <A
    HREF="#ref_ChapLocSyms">3.8</A>). The nesting is indicated by
    indentations (Pascal like).</LI>
<LI> <TT>t</TT>: by means of this switch it is possible to separate
    single components of the standard issued assembler-listing. The
    assignment of bits to parts can be found in the next section,
    where the exact format of the assembly listing is explained.</LI>
<LI> <TT>D</TT>: defines symbols. The symbols which are specified behind
    this option and separated by commas are written to the global
    symbol table before starting the assembly. As default these
    symbols are written as integer numbers with the value TRUE, by
    means of an appended equal sign, however, you can select other
    values. The expression following the equals sign may include
    operators or internal functions, but<B> not</B> any further
    symbols, even if these should have been defined before in the
    list! Together with the commands for conditional assembly (see
    there) you may produce different program versions out of one
    source file by command line inputs.<B> CAUTION!</B> If the
    case-sensitive mode is used, this has to be specified in the
    command line<EM> before</EM> any symbol definitions, otherwise
    symbol names will be converted to upper case at this place!</LI>
<LI> <TT>A</TT>: stores the list of global symbols in another, more
    compact form. Use this option if the assembler crashes with a
    stack overflow because of too long symbol tables. Sometimes this
    option can increase the processing speed of the assembler, but
    this depends on the sources.</LI>
<LI> <TT>x</TT>: Sets the level of detail for error messages. The level
    is increased resp. decreased by one each time this option is
    given. While on level 0 (default) only the error message itself
    is printed, an extended message is added beginning at level 1
    that should simplify the identification of the error's cause.
    Appendix <A HREF="#ref_ChapErrMess">A</A> lists which error
    messages carry which extended messages. At level 2 (maximum), the
    source line containing the error is additionally printed.</LI>
<LI> <TT>n</TT>: If this option is set, the error messages will be issued
    additionally with their error number (see appendix <A
    HREF="#ref_ChapErrMess">A</A>). This is primarily intended for
    use with shells or IDE's to make the identification of errors
    easier by those numbers.</LI>
<LI> <TT>U</TT>: This option switches AS to the case-sensitive mode, i.e.
    upper and lower case in the names of symbols, sections, macros,
    character sets, and user-defined functions will be distinguished.
    This is not the case by default.</LI>
<LI> <TT>P</TT>: Instructs AS to write the source text processed by macro
    processor and conditional assembly into a file. Additional blank
    and pure comment lines are missing in this file. The extension of
    this file is<TT> I</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>M</TT>: If this switch is given, AS generates a file, that
    contains definitions of macros defined in the source file that
    did not use the<TT> NOEXPORT</TT> option. This new file has the
    same name as the source file, only the extension is modified
    into<TT> MAC</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>G</TT>: this switch defines whether AS should produce code or
    not. If switched off, the processing will be stopped after the
    macro processor. This switch is activated by default (logically,
    otherwise you would not get a code file). This switch can be used
    in conjunction with the<TT> P</TT> switch, if only the macro
    processor of AS shall be used.</LI>
<LI> <TT>r [n]</TT>: issue warnings if situations occur that force a
    further pass. This information can be used to reduce the number
    of passes. You may optionally specify the number of the first
    pass where issuing of such messages shall start. Without this
    argument, warnings will come starting with the first pass. Be
    prepared for a bunch of messages!!</LI>
<LI> <TT>cpu &lt;name&gt;</TT>: this switch allows to set the target
    processor AS shall generate code for, in case the source file
    does not contain a<TT> CPU</TT> instruction and is not 68008
    code.</LI>
<LI> <TT>alias &lt;new&gt;=&lt;old&gt;</TT>: defines the processor
    type<TT> &lt;new&gt;</TT> to be an alias for the type<TT>
    &lt;old&gt;</TT>. See section <A HREF="#ref_SectAlias">2.14</A>
    for the sense of processor aliases.</LI>
<LI> <TT> gnuerrors</TT>: display messages about errors resp. warnings
    not in the As standard format, but instaed in a format similar to
    the GNU C compiler. This simplifies the integration of AS into
    environments tuned for this format, however also suppresses the
    display of precise error positions in macro bodies!</LI>
</UL>
As long as switches require no arguments and their concatenation does
not result in a multi-letter switch, it is possible to specify
several switches at one time, as in the following example :
<PRE>

 as test*.asm firstprog -cl /i c:\as\8051\include

</PRE>
All files<TT> TEST*.ASM</TT> as well as the file<TT>
FIRSTPROG.ASM</TT> will be assembled, whereby listings of all files
are displayed on the console terminal. Additional sharefiles will be
generated in the C- format. The assembler should search for
additional include files in the directory C:\AS\8051\INCLUDE.
<P>
This example shows that the assembler assumes<TT> ASM</TT> as the
default extension for source files.
<P>
A bit of caution should be applied when using switches that have
optional arguments: if a file specification immediately follows such
aswitch without the optional argument, AS will try to interprete the
file specification as argument - what of course fails:
<PRE>

 as -g test.asm

</PRE>
The solution in this case would either be to move the -g option the
end or to specify an explicit MAP argument.
<P>
Beside from specifying options in the command line, permanently
needed options may be placed in the environment variable<TT>
ASCMD</TT>. For example, if someone always wants to have assembly
listings and has a fixed directory for include files, he can save a
lot of typing with the following command:
<PRE>

 set ascmd=-L -i c:\as\8051\include

</PRE>
The environment options are processed before the command line, so
options in the command line can override contradicting ones in the
environment variable.
<P>
In the case of very long path names, space in the<TT> ASCMD</TT>
variable may become a problem. For such cases a key file may be the
alternative, in which the options can be written in the same way as
in the command line or the<TT> ASCMD</TT>-variable. But this file may
contain several lines each with a maximum length of 255 characters.
In a key file it is important, that for options which require an
argument, switches and argument have to be written in the<B> same</B>
line. AS gets informed of the name of the key file by a<TT> @</TT>
aheaded in the<TT> ASCMD</TT> variable, e.g.
<PRE>

set ASCMD=@c:\as\as.key

</PRE>
In order to neutralize options in the<TT> ASCMD</TT> variable (or in
the key file), prefix the option with a plus sign. For example, if
you do not want to generate an assembly listing in an individual
case, the option can be retracted in this way:
<PRE>

as +L &lt;file&gt;

</PRE>
Naturally it is not consequently logical to deny an option by a plus
sign.... UNIX soit qui mal y pense.
<P>
References to key files may not only come from the<TT> ASCMD</TT>
variable, but also directly from the command line. Similarly to
the<TT> ASCMD</TT> variable, prepend the file's name with a @
character:
<PRE>
 
 as @&lt;file&gt; ....

</PRE>
The options read from a key file in this situation are processed as
if they had been written out in the command line in place of the
reference,<EM> not</EM> like the key file referenced by the<TT>
ASCMD</TT> variable that is processed prior to the command line
options.
<P>
Referencing a key file from a key file itself is not allowed and will
be answered wit an error message by AS.
<P>
In case that you like to start AS from another program or a shell and
this shell hands over only lower-case or capital letters in the
command line, the following workaround exists: if a tilde (~) is put
in front of an option letter, the following letter is always
interpreted as a lower-case letter. Similarly a<TT> #</TT> demands
the interpretation as a capital letter. For example, the following
transformations result for:
<PRE>

 /~I ---&gt; /i
 -#u ---&gt; -U

</PRE>
In dependence of the assembly's outcome, the assembler ends with the
following return codes:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0<DD>error free run, at maximum warnings occurred</DD>
<DT>1<DD>The assembler displayed only its command-line parameters and
    terminated immediately afterwards.</DD>
<DT>2<DD>Errors occurred during assembly, no code file has been produced.</DD>
<DT>3<DD>A fatal error occurred what led to immediate termination of the

Similar to UNIX, OS/2 extends an application's data segment on demand    
when the application really needs the memory. Therefore, an output
like
<PRE>

  511 KByte available memory

</PRE>
does not indicate a shortly to come system crash due to memory lack,
it simply shows the distance to the limit when OS/2 will push up the
data segment's size again...
<P>
As there is no compatible way in C under different operating systens     
to find out the amount of available memory resp. stack, both lines
are missing completely from the statistics the C version prints.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_5_">2.5. Format of the Input Files</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_AttrTypes"></A>
<P>
Like most assemblers, AS expects exactly one instruction per line
(blank lines are naturally allowed as well). The lines must not be
longer than 255 characters, additional characters are discarded.
<P>
A single line has following format:
<PRE>

[label[:]] &lt;mnemonic&gt;[.attr] [param[,param..]] [;comment]

</PRE>
A line may also be split over several lines in the source file,
continuation characters chain these parts together to a single line.
One must however consider that, due to the internal buffer structure,
the total line must not be longer than 256 characters. Line
references in error messages always relate to the last line of such a
composed source line.
<P>
The colon for the label is optional, in case the label starts in the
first column (the consequence is that a mnemonic must not start in
column 1). It is necessary to set the colon in case the label does
not start in the first column so that AS is able to distinguish it
from a mnemonic. In the latter case, there must be at least one space
between colon and mnemonic if the processor belongs to a family that
supports an attribute that denotes an instruction format and is
separated from the mnemonic by a colon. This restriction is necessary
to avoid ambiguities: a distinction between a mnemonic with format
and a label with mnemonic would otherwise be impossible.
<P>
Some signal processor families from Texas Instruments optionally use
a double line (||) in place of the label to signify the prallel
execution with the previous instruction(s). If these two assembler
instructions become a single instruction word at machine level (C3x),
an additional label in front of the second instruction of course does
not make sense and is not allowed. The situation is different for the
C6x with its instruction packets of variable length: If someone wants
to jump into the middle of an instruction packet (bad style, if you
ask me...), he has to place the necessary label<EM> before</EM> into
a separate line. The same is valid for conditions, which however may
be combined with the double line in a single source line.
<P>
The attribute is used by a couple of processors to specify variations
or different codings of a certain instruction. The most prominent
usage of the attibute is is the specification of the operand size,
for example in the case of the 680x0 family (table <A
HREF="#ref_TabAttrs">2.6</A>).

           NAME="ref_TabAttrs"></A>
</CENTER><P>

<P>
Since this manual is not also meant as a user's manual for the
processor families supported by AS, this is unfortunately not the
place to enumerate all possible attributes for all families. It
should however be mentioned that in general, not all instructions of
a given instruction set allow all attributes and that the omission of
an attribute generally leads to the usage of the ''natural'' operand
size of a processor family. For more thorough studies, consult a
reasonable programmer's manual, e.g. <A HREF="#cite_Williams">[1]</A>
for the 68K's.
<P>
In the case of TLCS-9000, H8/500, and M16(C), the attribute serves
both as an operand size specifier (if it is not obvious from the
operands) and as a description of the instruction format to be used.
A colon has to be used to separate the format from the operand size,
e.g. like this:
<PRE>

    add.w:g   rw10,rw8

</PRE>
This example does not show that there may be a format specification
without an operand size. In contrast, if an operand size is used
without a format specification, AS will automatically use the
shortest possible format. The allowed formats and operand sizes again
depend on the machine instruction and may be looked up e.g. in <A
HREF="#cite_Tosh900">[106]</A>, <A HREF="#cite_HitH8_5">[24]</A>, <A
HREF="#cite_MitM16">[44]</A>, resp. <A HREF="#cite_MitM16C">[45]</A>.
<P>
The number of instruction parameters depends on the mnemonic and is
principally located between 0 and 20. The separation of the
parameters from each other is to be performed only by commas
(exception: DSP56xxx, its parallel data transfers are separated with
blanks). Commas that are included in brackets or quotes, of course,
are not taken into consideration.
<P>
Instead of a comment at the end, the whole line can consist of
comment if it starts in the first column with a semicolon.
<P>
To separate the individual components you may also use tabulators
instead of spaces.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_6_">2.6. Format of the Listing</A></H2>
<P>
The listing produced by AS using the command line options i or I is
roughly divisible into the following parts :
<OL>
<LI>issue of the source code assembled;</LI>
<LI>symbol list;</LI>
<LI>usage list;</LI>
<LI>cross reference list.</LI>
</OL>
The two last ones are only generated if they have been demanded by
additional command line options.
<P>
In the first part, AS lists the complete contents of all source files
including the produced code. A line of this listing has the following
form:
<PRE>

[&lt;n&gt;] &lt;line&gt;/&lt;address&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;source&gt;

</PRE>
In the field<TT> n</TT>, AS displays the include nesting level. The
main file (the file where assembly was started) has the depth 0, an
included file from there has depth 1 etc.. Depth 0 is not displayed.
<P>
In the field<TT> line</TT>, the source line number of the referenced
file is issued. The first line of a file has the number 1. The
address at which the code generated from this line is written follows
after the slash in the field<TT> address</TT>.
<P>
The code produced is written behind<TT> address</TT> in the field<TT>
code</TT>, in hexadecimal notation. Depending on the processor type
and actual segment the values are formatted either as bytes or
16/32-bit-words. If more code is generated than the field can take,
additional lines will be generated, in which case only this field is
used.
<P>
Finally, in the field<TT> source</TT>, the line of the source file is
issued in its original form.
<P>
The symbol table was designed in a way that it can be displayed on an
80-column display whenever possible. For symbols of ''normal
length'', a double column output is used. If symbols exceed (with
their name and value) the limit of 40 columns (characters), they will
be issued in a separate line. The output is done in alphabetical
order. Symbols that have been defined but were never used are marked
with a star (*) as prefix.
<P>
The parts mentioned so far as well as the list of all
macros/functions defined can be selectively masked out from the
listing. This can be done by the already mentioned command line
switch<TT> -t</TT>. There is an internal byte inside AS whose bits
represent which parts are to be written. The assignment of bits to
parts of the listing is listed in table <A
HREF="#ref_TabTBits">2.7</A>.

All bits are set to 1 by default, when using the switch
<PRE>

Bits set in<TT> &lt;mask&gt;</TT> are cleared, so that the respective
listing parts are suppressed. Accordingly it is possible to switch on
single parts again with a plus sign, in case you had switched off too
much with the<TT> ASCMD</TT> variable... If someone wants to have,
for example, only the symbol table, it is enough to write:
<PRE>

-t 2  

</PRE>
The usage list issues the occupied areas hexadecimally for every
single segment. If the area has only one address, only this is
written, otherwise the first and last address.
<P>
The cross reference list issues any defined symbol in alphabetical
order and has the following form:
<PRE>

 symbol &lt;symbol name&gt; (=&lt;value&gt;,&lt;file&gt;/&lt;line&gt;): 
  file &lt;file 1&gt;:
  &lt;n1&gt;[(m1)]  ..... &lt;nk&gt;[(mk)]
  .
  .
  file &lt;file l&gt;:
  &lt;n1&gt;[(m1)]  ..... &lt;nk&gt;[(mk)]

</PRE>
The cross reference list lists for every symbol in which files and
lines it has been used. If a symbol was used several times in the
same line, this would be indicated by a number in brackets behind the
line number. If a symbol was never used, it would not appear in the
list; The same is true for a file that does not contain any
references for the symbol in question.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> AS can only print the listing correctly if it was
previously informed about the output media's page length and width!
This has to be done with the<TT> PAGE</TT> instruction (see there).
The preset default is a length of 60 lines and an unlimited line
width.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_7_">2.7. Symbol Conventions</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_SectSymConv"></A>
<P>
Symbols are allowed to be up to 255 characters long (as hinted
already in the introduction) and are being distinguished on the whole
length, but the symbol names have to meet some conventions: Symbol
names are allowed to consist of a random combination of letters,
digits, underlines and dots, whereby the first character must not be
a digit. The dot is only allowed to meet the MCS-51 notation of
register bits and should - as far as possible - not be used in own
symbol names. To separate symbol names in any case the underline
(<TT>_</TT>) and not the dot (<TT>.</TT>) should be used .
<P>
AS is by default not case-sensitive, i.e. it does not matter whether
one uses upper or lower case characters. The command line switch<TT>
U</TT> however allows to switch AS into a mode where upper and lower
case makes a difference. The predefined symbol<TT> CASESENSITIVE</TT>
signifies whether AS has been switched to this mode: TRUE means
case-sensitiveness, and FALSE its absence.
<P>
Table <A HREF="#ref_TabPredefined">2.8</A> shows the most important

<P>
Additionally some pseudo instructions define symbols that reflect the
value that has been set with these instructions. Their descriptions
are explained at the individual commands belonging to them.
<P>
A hidden feature (that has to be used with care) is that symbol names
may be assembled from the contents of string symbols. This can be
achieved by framing the string symbol's name with braces and
inserting it into the new symbol's name. This allows for example to
define a symbol's name based on the value of another symbol:
<PRE>

cnt             set     cnt+1
temp            equ     "\{CNT}"
                jnz     skip{temp}
                .
                .
skip{temp}:     nop

</PRE>
<B>CAUTION:</B> The programmer has to assure that only valid symbol
names are generated!
<P>
A complete list of all symbols predefined by AS can be found in
appendix <A HREF="#ref_AppInternSyms">E</A>.
<P>
Apart from its value, every symbol also owns a marker which signifies
to which<EM> segment</EM> it belongs. Such a distinction is mainly
needed for processors that have more than one address space. The
additional information allows AS to issue a warning when a wrong
instruction is used to access a symbol from a certain address space.
A segment attribute is automatically added to a symbol when is gets
defined via a label or a special instruction like<TT> BIT</TT>; a
symbol defined via the ''allround instructions''<TT> SET</TT>
resp.<TT> EQU</TT> is however ''typeless'', i.e. its usage will never
trigger warnings. A symbol's segment attribute may be queried via the
buit-in function<TT> SYMTYPE</TT>, e.g.:
<PRE>

Label:
        .
        .
Attr    equ     symtype(Label)  ; results in 1

</PRE>
The individual segment types have the assigned numbers listed in
table <A HREF="#ref_TabSegNums">2.9</A>. Register symbols which do
not really fit into the order of normal symbols are explained in
section <A HREF="#ref_SectRegSyms">2.12</A>. The<TT> SYMTYPE</TT>
function delivers -1 as result when called with an undefined symbol
as argument.

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_8_">2.8. Temporary Symbols</A></H2>
<P>
Especially when dealing with programs that contain sequences of loops
of if-like statements, one is continuously faced with the problem of
inventing new names for labels - labels of which you know exactly
that you will never need to reference them again afterwards and you
really would like to get 'rid' of them somehow. A simple solution if
you don't want to swing the large hammer of sections (see chapter <A
HREF="#ref_ChapLocSyms">3.8</A>) are<EM> temporary</EM> symbols which
remain valid as long as a new, non-temporary symbol gets defined.
Other assemblers offer a similar mechanism which is commonly referred
as 'local symbols'; however, for the sake of a better distinction, I
want to stay with the term 'temporary symbols'. AS knows three
different types of temporary symbols, in the hope to offer everyone
'switching' to AS a solution that makes conversion as easy as
possible. However, practically every assembler has its own
interpretation of this feature, so there will be only few cases where
a 1:1 solution for existing code:
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_9_">2.9. Named Temporary Symbols</A></H2>
<P>
A symbol whose name starts with two dollar signs (something that is
neither allowed for non-temporary symbols nor for constants) is a
named temporary symbol. AS keeps an internal counter which is reset
to 0 before assembly begins and which gets incremented upon every
definition of a non-temporary symbol. When a temporary symbol is
defined or referenced, both leading dollar signs are discarded and
the counter's current value is appended. This way, one regains the
used symbol names with every definition of a non-temporary symbol -
but you also cannot reach the previously symbols any more! Temporary
symbols are therefore especially suited for usage in small
instruction blocks, typically a dozen of machine instructions,
definitely not more than one screen. Otherwise, one easily gets
confused...
<P>
Here is a small example:
<PRE>

$$loop: nop
        dbra    d0,$$loop

split:

$$loop: nop
        dbra    d0,$$loop

</PRE>
Without the non-temporary label between the loops, of course an error
message about a double-defined symbol would be the result.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_9_1_">2.9.1. Nameless Temporary Symbols</A></H3>
<P>
For all those who regard named temporary symbols still as too
complicated, there is an even simpler variant: If one places a single
puls or minus sign as a label, this is converted to symbol names
of<TT> __forwnn</TT> respectively<TT> __backmm</TT>, with<TT> nn</TT>
respectively<TT> mm</TT> being counters that start counting at zero.
Those symbols are referenced via the special names<TT> - -- ---</TT>
respectively<TT> + ++ +++</TT>, which refer to the three last 'minus
symbols' and the next three 'plus symbols'. Therefore, the selection
between these two variants depends on whether one wants to forward-
or backward-reference a symbol.
<P>
Apart from plus and minus,<EM> defining</EM> nameless temporary
symbols also exists in a third variant, namely a slash (/). A
temporary symbol defined in this way may be referenced both backward
and forward, i.e. it is treated either as a plus or a minus,
depending on the way it is being referenced.
<P>
Nameless temporary symbols are usually used in constructs that fit on
one screen page, like skipping a few machine instructions or tight
loops - things would becone to puzzling otherwise (this only a good
advice, however...). An example for this is the following piece of
code, this time as 65xx code:
<PRE>

        cpu     6502

-       ldx     #00
-       dex
        bne     -           ; branch to 'dex'
        lda     RealSymbol
        beq     +           ; branch to 'bne --'
        jsr     SomeRtn
        iny
+       bne     --          ; branch to 'ldx #00'

SomeRtn:
        rts

RealSymbol:
        dfs     1

  	inc	ptr
   	bne 	+      	    ; branch to 'tax'
   	inc 	ptr+1
+ 	tax

 	bpl 	++     	    ; branch to 'dex'
   	beq 	+      	    ; branch forward to 'rts'
   	lda 	#0
/  	rts            	    ; slash used as wildcard.
+ 	dex
   	beq 	-           ; branch backward to 'rts'

ptr:	dfs	2

</PRE>
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_9_2_">2.9.2. Composed Temporary Symbols</A></H3>
<P>
This is maybe the type of temporary symbols that is nearest to the
concept of local symbols and sections. Whenever a symbol's name
begins with a dot (.), the symbol is not directly stored with this
name in the symbol table. Instead, the name of the most
recently-defined symbol not beginning with a dot is prepended to the
symbols name. This way, 'non-dotted' symbols take the role of section
separators and 'dotted' symbol names may be reused after a
'non-dotted' symbol has been defined. Take a look at the following
little example:
<PRE>

proc1:				; non-temporary symbol 'proc1'

.loop	moveq	#20,d0		; actually defines 'proc1.loop'
	dbra	d0,.loop
	rts

proc2:				; non-temporary symbol 'proc2'

.loop	moveq	#10,d1		; actually defines 'proc2.loop'
	jsr	proc1
	dbra	d1,.loop
	rts

</PRE>
Note that it is still possible to access all temporary symbols, even
without being in the same 'area', by simply using the composed name
(like 'proc2.loop' in the previous example).
<P>
It is principally possible to combine composed temporary symbols with
sections, which makes them also to local symbols. Take however into
account that the most recent non-temporary symbol is not stored
per-section, but simply globally. This may change however in a future
version, so one shouldn't rely on the current behaviour.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_10_">2.10. Formula Expressions</A></H2>
<P>
In most places where the assembler expects numeric inputs, it is
possible to specify not only simple symbols or constants, but also
complete formula expressions. The components of these formula
expressions can be either single symbols and constants. Constants may
be either integer, floating point, or string constants.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_10_1_">2.10.1. Integer Constants</A></H3>
<A NAME="ref_SectIntConsts"></A>
<P>
Integer constants describe non-fractional numbers. They may either be
written as a sequence of digits or as a sequence of characters
enclosed in<EM> single</EM> quotation marks. In case they are written
as a sequence of digits, this may be done in different numbering
systems (table <A HREF="#ref_TabSystems">2.10</A>).

<P><CENTER>Table 2.10: Possible Numbering Systems<A NAME="ref_TabSystems"></A>
</CENTER><P>

In case the numbering system has not been explicitly stated by adding
the special control characters listed in the table, AS assumes the
base given with the<TT> RADIX</TT> statement (which has itself 10 as
default). This statement allows to set up 'unusual' numbering
systems, i.e. others than 2, 8, 10, or 16.
<P>
Valid digits are numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to Z (value
10 to 35) up to the numbering system's base minus one. The usage of
letters in integer constants however brings along some ambiguities
since symbol names also are sequences of numbers and letters: a
symbol name must not start with a character from 0 to 9. This means
that an integer constant which is not clearly marked a such with a
special prefix character never mav begin with a letter. One has to
add an additional, otherwise superfluous zero in front in such cases.
The most prominent case is the writing of hexadecimal constants in
Intel mode: If the leftmost digit is between A and F, the trailing H
doesn't help anything, an additional 0 has to be prefixed (e.g. 0F0H
instead of F0H). The Motorola and C syntaxes whis both mark the
numbering system at the front of a constant do not have this problem
(<I>hehehe..</I>).
<P>
Quite tricky is furthermore that the higher the default numbering
system set via<TT> RADIX</TT> becomes, the more letters used to
denote numbering systems in Intel and C syntax become 'eaten'. For
example, you cannot write binary constants anymore after a<TT> RADIX
16</TT>, and starting at<TT> RADIX 18</TT>, the Intel syntax even
doesn't allow to write hexadecimal constants any more. Therefore<B>
CAUTION!</B>
<P>
With the help of the<TT> RELAXED</TT> instruction (see section <A
HREF="#ref_SectRELAXED">3.9.6</A>), the strict assignment of a syntax
to a certain target processor can be removed. The result is that an
arbitrary syntax may be used (loosing compatibility to standard
assemblers). This option is however turned off by default. This
option also opens the opportunity for a fourth way of writing integer
constants, a way that is sometimes found on other assemblers: This
way puts the actual value into apostrophes and prepends the numbering
system ('x' or 'h' for hexadecimal, 'o' for octal and 'b' for
binary). So, the integer constant 305419896 can be written in the
following ways:
<PRE>

 x'12345678'
 h'12345678'
 o'2215053170'
 b'00010010001101000101011001111000'

</PRE>
This syntax is noth the default for any processor architecture and
only available in<TT> RELAXED</TT> mode. Its main purpose is the
easier porting of existing sources and is not recommended for new
programs.
<P>
Integer constants may also be written as ASCII values, like in the
following examples:
<PRE>

'A'    ==$41
'AB'   ==$4142
'ABCD' ==$41424344

</PRE>
It is important to write the characters in<EM> single quotes</EM>, to
distinguish them from string constants (discussed somewhat later).
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_10_2_">2.10.2. Floating Point Constants</A></H3>
<P>
Floating point constants are to be written in the usual scientific
notation, which is known in the most general form:
<PRE>

 [-]&lt;integer digits&gt;[.post decimal positions][E[-]exponent]

</PRE>
<B>CAUTION!</B> The assembler first tries to interprete a constant as
an integer constant and makes a floating-point format try only in
case the first one failed. If someone wants to enforce the evaluation
as a floating point number, this can be done by dummy post decimal
positions, e.g.<TT> 2.0</TT> instead of<TT> 2</TT>.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_10_3_">2.10.3. String Constants</A></H3>
<A NAME="ref_SectStringConsts"></A>
<P>
String constants have to be included in<EM> double quotation</EM>
marks (to distinguish them from the abovementioned ASCII-integers).
In order to make it possible to write quotation marks and special
characters without trouble in string constants, an ''escape
mechanism'' has been implemented, which should sound familiar for C
programmers:
<P>
The assembler understands a backslash (\) with a following decimal
number of three digits maximum in the string as a character with the
according decimal ASCII value. The numerical value may alternitavely
be written in hexadecimal or octal notation if it is prefixed with an
x resp. a 0. In case of hexadecimal notation, the maximum number of
digits is limited to 2. For example, it is possible to include an ETC
character by writing<TT>\3</TT>. But be careful with the definition
of NUL characters! The C version currently uses C strings to store       
strings internally. As C strings use a NUL character for termination,
the usage of NUL characters in strings is currently not portable!
<P>
Some frequently used control characters can also be reached with the
following abbreviations:
<PRE>

\b : Backspace           \a : Bell         \e : Escape
\t : Tabulator           \n : Linefeed     \r : Carriage Return
\\ : Backslash           \' or \H : Apostrophe 
\" or \I : Quotation marks

</PRE>
Both upper and lower case characters may be used for the
identification letters.
<P>
By means of this escape character, you can even work formula
expressions into a string, if they are enclosed by braces: e.g.
<PRE>

     message "root of 81 : \{sqrt(81)}"

</PRE>
results in
<PRE>

              root of 81 : 9

</PRE>
AS chooses with the help of the formula result type the correct
output format, further string constants, however, are to be avoided
in the expression. Otherwise the assembler will get mixed up at the
transformation of capitals into lower case letters. Integer results
will by default be written in hexadecimal notation, which may be
changed via the<TT> OUTRADIX</TT> instruction.
<P>
Except for the insertion of formula expressions, you can use this
''escape-mechanism'' as well in ASCII defined integer constants, like
this:
<PRE>

     move.b   #'\n',d0

</PRE>
However, everything has its limits, because the parser with higher
priority, which disassembles a line into op-code and parameters, does
not know what it is actually working with, e.g. here:
<PRE>

     move.l   #'\'abc',d0

</PRE>
After the third apostrophe, it will not find the comma any more,
because it presumes that it is the start of a further character
constant. An error message about a wrong parameter number is the
result. A workaround would be to write e.g., \i instead of \'.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_10_4_">2.10.4. Evaluation</A></H3>
<P>
The calculation of intermediary results within formula expressions is
always done with the highest available resolution, i.e. 32 bits for
integer numbers, 80 bit for floating point numbers and 255 characters
for strings. An possible test of value range overflows is done only
on the final result.
<P>
The portable C version only supports floating point values up to 64      
bits (resulting in a maximum value of roughly 10<SUP> 308</SUP>), but
in turn features integer lengths of 64 bits on some platforms.
<P>

<P><CENTER>Table 2.11: Operators Predefined by AS<A NAME="ref_TabOps"></A>
</CENTER><P>

''Rank'' is the priority of an operator at the separation of
expressions into subexpressions. The operator with the highest rank
will be evaluated at the very end. The order of evaluation can be
defined by new bracketing.
<P>
The compare operators deliver TRUE in case the condition fits, and
FALSE in case it doesn't. For the logical operators an expression is
TRUE in case it is not 0, otherwise it is FALSE.
<P>
The mirroring of bits probably needs a little bit of explanation: the
operator mirrors the lowest bits in the first operand and leaves the
higher priority bits unchanged. The number of bits which is to be
mirrored is given by the right operand and may be between 1 and 32 .
<P>
A small pitfall is hidden in the binary complement: As the
computation is always done with 32 resp. 64 bits, its application on
e.g. 8-bit masks usually results in values taht do not fit into 8-bit
numbers any more due to the leading ones. A binary AND with a fitting
mask is therefore unavoidable!
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_2_10_6_">2.10.6. Functions</A></H3>

In addition to the operators, the assembler defines another line of
primarily transcendental functions with floating point arguments

The functions<TT> FIRSTBIT</TT>,<TT> LASTBIT</TT>, and<TT>
BITPOS</TT> return -1 as result if no resp. not exactly one bit is
set.<TT> BITPOS</TT> additionally issues an error message in such a
case.
<P>
The string function<TT> SUBSTR</TT> expects the source string as
first parameter, the start position as second and the number of
characters to be extracted as third parameter (a 0 means to extract
all characters up to the end). Similarly,<TT> CHARFROMSTR</TT>
expects the source string as first argument and the character
position as second argument. In case the position argument is larger
or equal to the source string's length,<TT> SUBSTR</TT> returns an
empty string while<TT> CHARFROMSTR</TT> returns -1. A position
argument smaller than zero is treated as zero by<TT> SUBSTR</TT>,
while<TT> CHARFROMSTR</TT> will return -1 also in this case.
<P>
Here is an example how to use these both functions. The task is to
put a string into memory, with the string end being signified by a
set MSB in the last character:
<P>
<PRE>

dbstr   macro   arg
        if      strlen(arg) &gt; 1
         db     substr(arg, 0, strlen(arg) - 1)
        endif
        if      strlen(arg) &gt; 0
         db     charfromstr(arg, strlen(arg) - 1) | 80h
        endif
        endm 

</PRE>
<P>
<TT> STRSTR</TT> returns the first occurence of the second string
within the first one resp. -1 if the search pattern was not found.
Similarly to<TT> SUBSTR</TT> and<TT> CHARFROMSTR</TT>, the first
character has the position 0.
<P>
If a function expects floating point arguments, this does not mean it
is impossible to write e.g.
<PRE>

    sqr2 equ sqrt(2)

</PRE>
In such cases an automatic type conversion is engaged. In the reverse
case the<TT> INT</TT>-function has to be applied to convert a
floating point number to an integer. When using this function, you
have to pay attention that the result produced always is a signed
integer and therefore has a value range of approximately +/-2.0E9.
<P>
When AS is switched to case-sensitive mode, predefined functions may
be accessed with an arbitrary combination of upper and lower case (in
contrast to predefined symbols). However, in the case of user-defined
functions (see section <A HREF="#ref_SectFUNCTION">3.4.9</A>), a
distinction between upper and lower case is made. This has e.g. the
result that if one defines a function<TT> Sin</TT>, one can
afterwards access this function via<TT> Sin</TT>, but all other
combinations of upper and lower case will lead to the predefined
function.
<P>
For a correct conversion of lower case letters into capital letters a    
DOS version >= 3.30 is required.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_11_">2.11. Forward References and Other Disasters</A></H2>
<P>
This section is the result of a significant amount of hate on the
(legal) way some people program. This way can lead to trouble in
conjunction with AS in some cases. The section will deal with
so-called 'forward references'. What makes a forward reference
different from a usual reference? To understand the difference, take
a look at the following programming example (please excuse my bias
for the 68000 family that is also present in the rest of this
manual):
<PRE>

        move.l  #10,d0
loop:   move.l  (a1),d1
        beq     skip   
        neg.l   d1     
skip:   move.l  d1,(a1+)
        dbra    d0,loop 

</PRE>
If one overlooks the loop body with its branch statement, a program
remains that is extremely simple to assemble: the only reference is
the branch back to the body's beginning, and as an assembler
processes a program from the beginning to the end, the symbol's value
is already known before it is needed the first time. If one has a
program that only contains such backward references, one has the nice
situation that only one pass through the source code is needed to
generate a correct and optimal machine code. Some high level
languages like Pascal with their strict rule that everything has to
be defined before it is used exploit exactly this property to speed
up the compilation.
<P>
Unfortunately, things are not that simple in the case of assembler,
because one sometimes has to jump forward in the code or there are
reasons why one has to move variable definitions behind the code. For
our example, this is the case for the conditional branch that is used
to skip over another instruction. When the assembler hits the branch
instruction in the first pass, it is confronted with the situation of
either leaving blank all instruction fields related to the target
address or offering a value that ''hurts noone'' via the formula
parser (which has to evaluate the address argument). In case of a
''simple'' assembler that supports only one target architecture with
a relatively small number of instructions to treat, one will surely
prefer the first solution, but the effort for AS with its dozens of
target architectures would have become extremely high. Only the
second way was possible: If an unknown symbol is detected in the
first pass, the formula parser delivers the program counter's current
value as result! This is the only value suitable to offer an address
to a branch instruction with unknown distance length that will not
lead to errors. This answers also a frequently asked question why a
first-pass listing (it will not be erased e.g. when AS does not start
a second pass due to additional errors) partially shows wrong
addresses in the generated binary code - they are the result of
unresolved forward references.
<P>
The example listed above however uncovers an additional difficulty of
forward references: Depending on the distance of branch instruction
and target in the source code, the branch may be either long or
short. The decision however about the code length - and therefore
about the addresses of following labels - cannot be made in the first
pass due to missing knowledge about the target address. In case the
programmer did not explicitly mark whether a long or short branch
shall be used, genuine 2-pass assemblers like older versions of MASM
from Microsoft ''solve'' the problem by reserving space for the
longest version in the first pass (all label addresses have to be
fixed after the first pass) and filling the remaining space with<TT>
NOP</TT>s in the second pass. AS versions up to 1.37 did the same
before I switched to the multipass principle that removes the strict
separation into two passes and allows an arbitrary number of passes.
Said in detail, the optimal code for the assumed values is generated
in the first pass. In case AS detects that values of symbols changed
in the second pass due to changes in code lengths, simply a third
pass is done, and as the second pass'es new symbol values might again
shorten or lengthen the code, a further pass is not impossible. I
have seen 8086 programs that needed 12 passes to get everything
correct and optimal. Unfortunately, this mechanism does not allow to
specify a maximum number passes; I can only advise that the number of
passes goes down when one makes more use of explicit length
specifications.
<P>
Especially for large programs, another situation might arise: the
position of a forward directed branch has moved so much in the second
pass relative to the first pass that the old label value still valid
is out of the allowed branch distance. AS knows of such situations
and suppresses all error messages about too long branches when it is
clear that another pass is needed. This works for 99% of all cases,
but there are also constructs where the first critical instruction
appears so early that AS had no chance up to now to recognize that
another pass is needed. The following example constructs such a
situation with the help of a forward reference (and was the reason
for this section's heading...):
<PRE>

        cpu   6811

        org     $8000
        beq     skip
        rept    60
         ldd    Var
        endm
skip:   nop

Var     equ     $10

</PRE>
Due to the address position, AS assumes long addresses in the first
pass for the<TT> LDD</TT> instructions, what results in a code length
of 180 bytes and an out of branch error message in the second pass
(at the point of the<TT> BEQ</TT> instruction, the old value of<TT>
skip</TT> is still valid, i.e. AS does not know at this point that
the code is only 120 bytes long in reality) is the result. The error
can be avoided in three different ways:
<OL>
<LI>Explicitly tell AS to use short addressing for the<TT> LDD</TT>
    instructions (<TT>ldd &lt;Var</TT>)</LI>
<LI>Remove this damned, rotten forward reference and place the<TT>
    EQU</TT> statement at the beginning where it has to be (all
    right, I'm already calming down...)</LI>
<LI>For real die-hards: use the<TT> -Y</TT> command line option. This
    option tells AS to forget the error message when the address
    change has been detected. Not pretty, but...</LI>
</OL>
Another tip regarding the<TT> EQU</TT> instruction: AS cannot know in
which context a symbol defined with<TT> EQU</TT> will be used, so
an<TT> EQU</TT> containing forward references will not be done at all
in the first pass. Thus, if the symbol defined with<TT> EQU</TT> gets
forward-referenced in the second pass:
<PRE>

        move.l  #sym2,d0
sym2    equ     sym1+5
sym1    equ     0

</PRE>
one gets an error message due to an undefined symbol in the second
pass...but why on earth do people do such things?
<P>
Admittedly, this was quite a lengthy excursion, but I thought it was
necessary. Which is the essence you should learn from this section?
<OL>
<LI>AS always tries to generate the shortest code possible. A finite
    number of passes is needed for this. If you do not tweak AS
    extremely, AS will know no mercy...</LI>
<LI>Whenever sensible and possible, explicitly specify branch and address
    lengths. There is a chance of significantly reducing the number
    of passes by this.</LI>
<LI>Limit forward references to what is absolutely needed. You make your
    and AS's live much easier this way!</LI>

<P>
<EM> valid for: PowerPC, M-Core, 4004/4040, 80C16x, AVR</EM>
<P>
Sometimes it is desirable not only to assign symbolic names to memory
addresses or constants, but also to a register, to emphasize its
function in a certain program section. This is no problem for
processors that treat registers simply as another address space, as
this allows to use numeric expressions and one can use simple<TT>
EQU</TT>s to define such symbols. (e.g. for the MCS-96 or TMS70000).
However, for most processors, register identifiers are fixed literals
which are seperately treated by AS for speed reasons. A special
mechanism is therefore necessary to define symbolic register names. A
register symbol is usually defined via the<TT> REG</TT> instruction,
which has otherwise the same syntax as an<TT> EQU</TT> definition.
This however has a couple of restrictions: A register symbol is a
pure character string stored 'as is' which may exclusively be used
this way. For example, no arithmetic is allowed to calculate a
register's successor, like in the following example:
<PRE>

myreg   reg     r17         ; definition of register symbol
        addi    myreg+1,3   ; does not work!

</PRE>
Additionally, a register symbol has to be defined prior to ist first
usage; a forward reference would have the result that AS suspects a
forward reference to a memory location in case a register symbol is
not found. Since the usage of memory operands is far more limited on
most processors, a bunch of errors would be the result...
<P>
Analogous to ordinary symbols, register symbols are local to sections
and it is possible to access a register symbol from a specific
section by appending the section's name enclosed in brackets. Due to
the missing ability to do forward references, there is nothing like
a<TT> FORWARD</TT> directive, and an export by something comparable
to<TT> PUBLIC</TT> or<TT> GLOBAL</TT> is also not possible since
register symbols generally have their meaning in a small context.
<P>
If there is both an ordinary and a register symbol of same name
present in a context, the register symbol will be preferred. This is
however not the case when the name is embedded into a complex
expression (parentheses are sufficient!), the normal symbol will be
used then.

<P>
This function is a by-product from the old pure-68000 predecessors of
AS, I have kept them in case someone really needs it. The basic
problem is to access certain symbols produced during assembly,
because possibly someone would like to access the memory of the
target system via this address information. The assembler allows to
export symbol values by means of<TT> SHARED</TT> pseudo commands (see
there). For this purpose, the assembler produces a text file with the
required symbols and its values in the second pass. This file may be
included into a higher-level language or another assembler program.
The format of the text file (C, Pascal or Assembler) can be set by
the command line switches<TT> p, c</TT> or,<TT> a</TT>.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> If none of the switches is given, no file will be
generated and it makes no difference if<TT> SHARED</TT>-commands are
in the source text or not!
<P>
When creating a Sharefile, AS does not check if a file with the same
name already exists, such a file will be simply overwritten. In my
opinion a request does not make sense, because AS would ask at each
run if it should overwrite the old version of the Sharefile, and that
would be really annoying...

<H2><A NAME="sect_2_14_">2.14. Processor Aliases</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_SectAlias"></A>
<P>
Common microcontroller families are like rabbits: They become more at
a higher speed than you can provide support for them. Especially the
development of processor cores as building blocks for ASICs and of
microcontroller families with user-definable peripherals has led to a
steeply rising number of controllers that only deviate from a
well-known type by a slightly modified peripheral set. But the
distinction among them is still important, e.g. for the design of
include files that only define the appropriate subset of peripherals.
I have struggled up to now to integrate the most important
reperesentatives of a processor family into AS (and I will continue
to do this), but sometimes I just cannot keep pace with the
development...there was an urgent need for a mechanism to extend the
list of processors by the user.
<P>
The result are processor aliases: the alias command line option
allows to define a new processor type, whose instruction set is equal
to another processor built into AS. After switching to this processor
via the<TT> CPU</TT> instruction, AS behaves exactly as if the
original processor had been used, with a single difference: the
variables<TT> MOMCPU</TT> resp.<TT> MOMCPUNAME</TT> are set to the
alias name, which allows to use the new name for differentiation,
e.g. in include files.
<P>
There were two reasons to realize the definition of aliases by the
command line and not by pseudo instructions: first, it would anyway
be difficult to put the alias definitions together with register
definitions into a single include file, because a program that wants
to use such a file would have to include it before and after the CPU
instruction - an imagination that lies somewhere between inelegant
and impossible. Second, the definition in the command line allows to
put the definitions in a key file that is executed automatically at
startup via the<TT> ASCMD</TT> variable, without a need for the
program to take any further care about this.

in the following example:

DefVec  macro   Name    ; allocate a new vector

        DefVec  Vec1    ; results in Vec1=0
        DefVec  Vec2    ; results in Vec2=4

</PRE>
constants and variables are internally stored in the same way, the
only difference is that they are marked as unchangeable if defined
via<TT> EQU</TT>. Trying to change a constant with<TT> SET</TT> will
result in an error message.<TT> EQU/SET</TT> allow to define
constants of all possible types, e.g.
<PRE>

IntTwo   equ    2

Some processors unfortunately have already a<TT> SET</TT>
instruction. For these targets,<TT> EVAL</TT> must be used instead
of<TT> SET</TT>.
<P>
A simple equation sign may be used instead of<TT> EQU</TT>.
Similarly, one may simply write<TT> :=</TT> instead of<TT> SET</TT>
resp.<TT> EVAL</TT>.
<P>
For compatibility reasons to the original assembler, the KCPSM target
also knows the<TT> CONSTANT</TT> statement, which - in contrast

<PRE>

</PRE>
<TT> CONSTANT</TT> is however limited to integer constants.
<P>
Symbols defined with<TT> SET</TT> or<TT> EQU</TT> are typeless by
default, but optionally a segment name (<TT>CODE, DATA, IDATA, XDATA,

not check at this point if the used address space exists on the

These instructions act like<TT> EQU</TT>, but symbols defined with

range of values is equal to the range allowed for<TT> ORG</TT> in the
data segment (see section <A HREF="#ref_SectORG">3.2.1</A>). The
difference between<TT> SFR</TT> and<TT> SFRB</TT> is that<TT>
SFRB</TT> marks the register as bit addressable, which is why AS
generates 8 additional symbols which will be assigned to the bit
segment and carry the names xx.0 to xx.7, e.g.
<PRE>

PSW     sfr     0d0h    ; results in PSW = D0H (data segment)

PSW     sfrb    0d0h    ; results in extra PSW.0 = D0H (bit)
                        ;               to PSW.7 = D7H (bit)

</PRE>
The<TT> SFRB</TT> instruction is not any more defined for the 80C251

symbols; bits like<TT> PSW.0</TT> to<TT> PSW.7</TT> are automatically
present.
<P>
Whenever a bit-addressable register is defined via<TT> SFRB</TT>, AS
checks if the memory address is bit addressable (range 20h..3fh resp.
80h, 88h, 90h, 98h...0f8h). If it is not bit-addressable, a warning
is issued and the generated bit symbols are undefined.

<TT> BIT</TT> serves to equate a single bit of a memory cell with a
symbolic name. This instruction varies from target platform to target
platform due to the different ways in which processors handle bit
manipulation and addressing:
<P>
The MCS/51 family has an own address space for bit operands. The
function of<TT> BIT</TT> is therefore quite similar to<TT> SFR</TT>,
i.e. a simple integer symbol with the specified value is generated
and assigned to the<TT> BDATA</TT> segment. For all other processors,
bit addressing is done in a two-dimensional fashion with address and
bit position. In these cases, AS packs both parts into an integer
symbol in a way that depends on the currently active target processor
and separates both parts again when the symbol is used. The latter is
is also valid for the 80C251: While an instruction like
<PRE>

My_Carry bit    PSW.7

</PRE>
would assign the value 0d7h to<TT> My_Carry</TT> on an 8051, a value
of 070000d0h would be generated on an 80C251, i.e. the address is
located in bits 0..7 and the bit position in bits 24..26. This
procedure is equal to the way the<TT> DBIT</TT> instruction handles
things on a TMS370 and is also used on the 80C166, with the only
difference that bit positions may range from 0..15:
<PRE>

MSB     BIT     r5.15

</PRE>
On a Philips XA, the bit's address is located in bits 0..9 just with
the same coding as used in machine instructions, and the 64K bank of
bits in RAM memory is placed in bits 16..23.
<P>
The<TT> BIT</TT> instruction of the 75K0 family even goes further: As
bit expressions may not only use absolute base addresses, even
expressions like
<PRE>

are allowed.

<P>
Single board systems, especially when driving LCDs, frequently use
character sets different to ASCII. So it is probably purely
coincidental that the umlaut coding corresponds with the one used by
the PC. To avoid error-prone manual encoding, the assembler contains
a translation table for characters which assigns a target character
to each source-code. To modify this table (which initial translates
1:1), one has to use the<TT> CHARSET</TT> instruction.<TT>
CHARSET</TT> may be used with different numbers and types of
parameters. If there is only a single parameter, it has to be a
string expression which is interpreted as a file name by AS. AS reads
the first 256 bytes from this table and copies them into the
translation table. This allows to activate complex, externally
generated tables with a single statement. For all other variants, the
first parameter has to be an integer in the range of 0 to 255 which
designates the start index of the entries to be modified in the
translation table. One or two parameters follow, giving the type of
modification:
<P>
A single additional integer modies exactly one entry. For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT> CHARSET '&auml;',128</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
means that the target system codes the '&auml;' into the number 128
(80H). If however two more integers are given, the first one
describes the last entry to be modified, and the second the new value
of the first table entry. All entries up to the index end are loaded
sequentially. For example, in case that the target system does not
support lower-case characters, a simple
<PRE>

        CHARSET 'a','z','A'

</PRE>
translates all lower-case characters automatically into the matching
capital letters.
<P>
For the last variant, a string follows the start index and contains
the characters to be placed in the table. The last example therefore
may also be written as
<PRE>

        CHARSET 'a',"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

</PRE>
<P>
<TT> CHARSET</TT> may also be called without any parameters, which
however has a drastical effect: the translation table is
reinitialized to its initial state, i.e. all character translations
are removed.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B><TT> CHARSET</TT> not only affects string constants

character assignment between host and target platform, switching
among different character<EM> sets</EM> can become quite tedious if
several character sets have to be supported on the target platform.
The<TT> CODEPAGE</TT> instruction however allows to define and keep
different character sets and to switch with a single statement among
them.<TT> CODEPAGE</TT> expects one or two arguments: the name of the
set to be used hereafter and optionally the name of another table
that defines its initial contents (the second parameter therefore
only has a meaning for the first switch to the table when AS
automatically creates it). If the second parameter is missing, the
initial contents of the new table are copied from the previously
active set. All subsequent<TT> CHARSET</TT> statements<EM> only</EM>
modify the new set.
<P>
At the beginning of a pass, AS automatically creates a single
character set with the name<TT> STANDARD</TT> with a one-to-one
translation. If no<TT> CODEPAGE</TT> instructions are used, all
settings made via<TT> CHARSET</TT> refer to this table.

<A NAME="index_ENUM_1"></A>
<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
Similar to the same-named instruction known from C,<TT> ENUM</TT> is
used to define enumeration types, i.e. a sequence of integer
constants that are assigned sequential values starting at 0. The
parameters are the names of the symbols, like in the following
example:
<PRE>

        ENUM    SymA,SymB,SymC

</PRE>
This instruction will assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to the
symbols<TT> SymA, SymB,</TT> and<TT> SymC</TT>.
<P>
<TT> ENUM</TT> instructions are always single-line instructions, i.e.
the enumeration will again start at zero when a new<TT> ENUM</TT>
instruction is found. Multi-line enumerations may however be achieved
with a small trick that exploits the fact that the internal counter
can be set to a new value with an explicit assignment, like in the
following case:
<PRE>

        ENUM    January=1,February,March,April,May,June

</PRE>
The numeric values 1..6 are assigned to month names. One can continue
the enumeration in the following way:
<PRE>

        ENUM    July=June+1,August,September,October
        ENUM    November=October+1,December

</PRE>
A definition of a symbol with<TT> ENUM</TT> is equal to a definition
with<TT> EQU</TT>, i.e. it is not possible to assign a new value to a
symbol that already exists.

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_1_13_">3.1.13. PUSHV and POPV</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_PUSHV_1"></A><A NAME="index_POPV_1"></A>
<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
<TT> PUSHV</TT> and<TT> POPV</TT> allow to temporarily save the value
of a symbol (that is not macro-local) and to restore it at a later
point of time. The storage is done on stacks, i.e. Last-In-First-Out
memory structures. A stack has a name that has to fulfill the general
rules for symbol names and it exists as long as it contains at least
one element: a stack that did not exist before is automatically
created upon<TT> PUSHV</TT>, and a stack becoming empty upon a<TT>
POPV</TT> is deleted automatically. The name of the stack that shall
be used to save or restore symbols is the first parameter of<TT>
PUSH</TT> resp.<TT> POPV</TT>, followed by a list of symbols as
further parameters. All symbols referenced in the list already have
to exist, it is therefore<B> not</B> possible to implicitly define
symbols with a<TT> POPV</TT> instruction.
<P>
Stacks are a global resource, i.e. their names are not local to
sections.
<P>
It is important to note that symbol lists are<B> always</B> processed
from left to right. Someone who wants to pop several variables from a
stack with a<TT> POPV</TT> therefore has to use the exact reverse
order used in the corresponding<TT> PUSHV</TT>!
<P>
The name of the stack may be left blank, like this:
<PRE>

        pushv   ,var1,var2,var3
        .
        .
        popv    ,var3,var2,var1

</PRE>
AS will then use a predefined internal default stack.
<P>
AS checks at the end of a pass if there are stacks that are not empty
and issues their names together with their ''filling level''. This
allows to find out if there are any unpaired<TT> PUSHVs</TT> or<TT>
POPVs</TT>. However, it is in no case possible to save values in a
stack beyond the end of a pass: all stacks are cleared at the
beginning of a pass!

<TT> ORG</TT> allows to load the internal address counter (of the
assembler) with a new value. The value range depends on the currently
selected segment and on the processor type (tables <A
HREF="#ref_TabORG1">3.1</A> to <A HREF="#ref_TabORG4">3.4</A>). The
lower bound is always zero, and the upper bound is the given value
minus 1:<SMALL>

<P>
In case that different variations in a processor family have address
spaces of different size, the maximum range is listed for each.
<P>
<TT> ORG</TT> is mostly needed to give the code a new starting
address or to put different, non-continuous code parts into one
source file. In case there is no explicit other value listet in a
table entry, the initial address for this segment (i.e. the start
address used without<TT> ORG</TT>) is 0.

<P>
The processors can roughly be distinguished in families, inside the
families different types additionally serve for a detailed
distinction:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE SUMMARY="No Summary" CELLPADDING=2>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> a)</TD><TD NOWRAP> 68008 -> 68000 -> 68010 -> 68012 -></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP></TD><TD NOWRAP> MCF5200 -> 68332 -> 68340 -> 68360 -></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP></TD><TD NOWRAP> 68020 -> 68030 -> 68040</TD></TR>
</TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The differences in this family lie in additional instructions and
addressing modes (starting from the 68020). A small exception is the
step to the 68030 that misses two instructions:<TT> CALLM</TT>
and<TT> RTM</TT>. The three representors of the 683xx family have the
same processor core (a slightly reduced 68020 CPU), however
completely different peripherals. MCF5200 represents the ColdFire
family from Motorola, RISC processors downwardly binary compatible to
the 680x0. For the 68040, additional control registers (reachable
via<TT> MOVEC</TT>) and instructions for control of the on-chip MMU
and caches were added.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    b) 56000 --> 56002 --> 56300
</BLOCKQUOTE>
While the 56002 only adds instructions for incrementing and
decrementing the accumulators, the 56300 core is almost a new
processor: all address spaces are enlarged from 64K words to 16M and
the number of instructions almost has been doubled.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    c) PPC403 -> MPPC403 -> MPC505 -> MPC601 -> RS6000
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The PPC403 is a reduced version of the PowerPC line without a
floating point unit, which is why all floating point instructions are
disabled for him; in turn, some microcontroller-specific instructions
have been added which are unique in this family. The GC variant of
the PPC403 incorporates an additional MMU and has therefore some
additional instructions for its control. The MPC505 (a
microcontroller variant without a FPU) only differ in its peripheral
registers from the 601 as long as I do not know it better - <A
HREF="#cite_Mot505">[58]</A> is a bit reluctant in this respect...
The RS6000 line knows a few instructions more (that are emulated on
many 601-based systems), IBM additionally uses different mnemonics
for their pure workstation processors, as a reminiscence of 370
mainframes...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    d) MCORE
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    e) XGATE
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    f) 6800 -> 6301 -> 6811
</BLOCKQUOTE>
While the 6301 only offers a few additional instructions, the 6811
delivers a second index register and much more instructions.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    g) 6809/6309 and 6805/68HC(S)08
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These processors are partially source-code compatible to the other
68xx processors, but they have a different binary code format and a
significantly reduced (6805) resp. enhanced (6809) instruction set.
The 6309 is a CMOS version of the 6809 which is officially only
compatible to the 6809, but inofficially offers more registers and a
lot of new instructions (see <A HREF="#cite_Kaku">[37]</A>).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    h) 68HC12 --> 68HC12X
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The 12X core offers a couple of new instructions, and existing
instructions were were enriched with new addressing modes.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    i) 68HC16
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    j) HD6413308 -> HD6413309
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These both names represent the 300 and 300H variants of the H8
family; the H version owns a larger address space (16Mbytes instead
of 64Kbytes), double-width registers (32 bits), and knows a few more
instructions and addressing modes. It is still binary upward
compatible.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    k) HD6475328 -> HD6475348 -> HD6475368 -> HD6475388
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These processors all share the same CPU core; the different types are
only needed to include the correct subset of registers in the
file<TT> REG53X.INC</TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    l) SH7000 -> SH7600 --> SH7700
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The processor core of the 7600 offers a few more instructions that
close gaps in the 7000's instruction set (delayed conditional and
relative and indirect jumps, multiplications with 32-bit operands and
multiply/add instructions). The 7700 series (also known as SH3)
furthermore offers a second register bank, better shift instructions,
and instructions to control the cache.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    m) 6502 -> 65(S)C02 / MELPS740 / 6502UNDOC
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The CMOS version defines some additional instructions, as well as a
number of some instruction/addressing mode combinations were added
which were not possible on the 6502. The Mitsubishi micro controllers
in opposite expand the 6502 instruction set primarily to bit
operations and multiplication / division instructions. Except for the
unconditional jump and instructions to increment/decrement the
accumulator, the instruction extensions are orthogonal. The 65SC02
lacks the bit manipulation instructions of the 65C02. The 6502UNDOC
processor type enables access to the "undocumented" 6502
instructions, i.e. the operations that result from the usage of bit
combinations in the opcode that are not defined as instructions. The
variants supported by AS are listed in the appendix containing
processor-specific hints.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    n) MELPS7700, 65816
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Apart from a '16-bit-version' of the 6502's instruction set, these
processors both offer some instruction set extensions. These are
however orthogonal as they are oriented along their 8-bit
predecessors (65C02 resp. MELPS-740). Partially, different mnemonics
are used for the same operations.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    o) MELPS4500
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    p) M16
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    q) M16C
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    r) 4004 -> 4040
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Opposed to its predecessor, the 4040 features about a dozen
additional machine instructions.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    s) 8008 -> 8008NEW Intel redefined the mnemonics around 1975, the
    second variant reflects this new instruction set. A simultaneous
    support of both sets was not possible due to mnemonic conflicts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    t) 8021, 8022, 8039, 80C39, 8048, 80C48, 8041, 8042

For the ROM-less versions 8039 and 80C39, the commands which are
using the BUS (port 0) are forbidden. The 8021 and 8022 are special
versions with a strongly shrinked instruction set, for which the 8022
has two A/D- converters and the necessary control-commands. It is
possible to transfer the CMOS-versions with the<TT> IDL</TT>-command
into a stop mode with lower current consumption. The 8041 and 8042
have some additional instructions for controlling the bus interface,
but in turn a few other commands were omitted. Moreover, the code
address space of these processors is not externally extendable, and
so AS limits the code segment of these processors to 1 resp. 2
Kbytes.

The 87C750 can only access a maximum of 2 Kbytes program memory which
is why it lacks the<TT> LCALL</TT> and<TT> LJMP</TT> instructions. AS
does not make any distinction among the processors in the middle,
instead it only stores the different names in the<TT> MOMCPU</TT>
variable (see below), which allows to query the setting with<TT>
IF</TT> instructions. An exception is the 80C504 that has a mask flaw
in its current versions. This flaw shows up when an<TT> AJMP</TT>
or<TT> ACALL</TT> instruction starts at the second last address of a
2K page. AS will automatically use long instructions or issues an
error message in such situations. The 80C251 in contrast represents a
drastic progress in the the direction 16/32 bits, larger address
spaces, and a more orthogonal instruction set. One might call the
80C390 the 'small solution': Dallas Semiconductor modified
instruction set and architecture only as far as it was necessary for
the 16 Mbytes large address spaces.

Apart from a different set of SFRs (which however strongly vary from
version to version), the 80196 knows several new instructions and
supports a 'windowing' mechanism to access the larger internal RAM.
The 80196N family extends the address space to 16 Mbytes and
introduces a set of instructions to access addresses beyond 64Kbytes.
The 80296 extends the CPU core by instructions for signal processing
and a second windowing register, however removes the Peripheral
Transaction Server (PTS) and therefore looses again two machine
instructions.

the 29245 not even owns a hardware multiplier, the two representors

While there are only a few additional instructions for the Z180, the

couple of instruction set extensions that make the overall
instruction set considerably more orthogonal, and new addressing
modes (referring to index register halves, stack relative). These
extensions partially already exist on the Z80 as undocumented

The<TT> CPU</TT> instruction needs the processor type as a simple

or

Regardless of the processor type currently set, the integer
variable<TT> MOMCPU</TT> contains the current status as a hexadecimal
number. For example,<TT> MOMCPU</TT>=$68010 for the 68010 or<TT>
MOMCPU</TT>=80C48H for the 80C48. As one cannot express all letters
as hexadecimal digits (only A..F are possible), all other letters
must must be omitted in the hex notation; for example,<TT>
MOMCPU</TT>=80H for the Z80.
<P>
You can take advantage of this feature to generate different code
depending on the processor type. For example, the 68000 does not have
a machine instruction for a subroutine return with stack correction.
With the variable<TT> MOMCPU</TT> you can define a macro that uses
the machine instruction or emulates it depending on the processor
type:
<PRE>

myrtd   macro   disp
        if      MOMCPU&lt;$68010 ; emulate for 68008 & 68000 
         move.l (sp),disp(sp)

Motorola integrated the MMU into the processor starting with the

extended MMU instructions when the target processor is 68030 or

disabled in a 68030-based system and the processor operates with an
external 68851. One can the use a<TT> FULLPMMU ON</TT> to tell AS
that the complete MMU instruction set is allowed. Vice versa, one may
use a<TT> FULLPMMU OFF</TT> to disable all additional instruction in

Processors of the 680x0 family are quite critical regarding odd
addresses: instructions must not start on an odd address, and data
accesses to odd addresses are only allowed bytewise up to the 68010.
The H8/300 family simply resets the lowest address bit to zero when
accessing odd addresses, the 500 in contrast 'thanks' with an
exception... AS therefore tries to round up data structures built
with<TT> DC</TT> or<TT> DS</TT> to an even number of bytes. This
however means for<TT> DC.B</TT> and<TT> DS.B</TT> that a padding byte
may have to be added. This behaviour can be turned on and off via
the<TT> PADDING</TT> instruction. Similar to the previous
instructions, the argument may be either<TT> ON</TT> or<TT> OFF</TT>,
and the current setting may be read from a symbol with the same

In some way,<TT> PACKING</TT> is similar to<TT> PADDING</TT>, it just
has a somewhat opposite effect: While<TT> PADDING</TT> extends the
disposed data to get full words and keep a possible alignment,<TT>
PACKING</TT> squeezes several values into a single word. This makes
sense for the AVR's code segment since the CPU has a special
instruction (<TT> LPM</TT>) to access single bytes within a 16-bit
word. In case this option is turned on (argument<TT> ON</TT>), two
byte values are packed into a single word by<TT> DATA</TT>, similar
to the single characters of string arguments. The value range of
course reduces to -128...+255. If this option is turned off
(argument<TT> OFF</TT>), each integer argument obtains its own word
and may take values from -32768...+65535.
<P>
This distinctin is only made for integer arguments of<TT> DATA</TT>,
strings will always be packed.. Keep further in mind that packing of
values only works within the arguments of a<TT> DATA</TT> statement;
if one has subsequent<TT> DATA</TT> statements, there will still be
half-filled words when the argument count is odd!

the minimum and maximum mode. Depending on the actual mode, the
execution environment and the assembler are a little bit different.
Along with this instruction and the parameter<TT> ON</TT> or<TT>
OFF</TT>, AS is informed that the following code will run in maximum
resp. minimum mode. The actual setting can be read from the
variable<TT> INMAXMODE</TT>. Presetting is<TT> OFF</TT>, i.e. minimum
mode.
<P>
Similarly, one uses this instruction to tell AS in H8 mode whether
the address space is 64K or 16 Mbytes. This setting is always<TT>
OFF</TT> for the 'small' 300 version and cannot be changed.

The Z380 may operate in altogether 4 modes, which are the result of
setting two flags: The XM flag rules whether the processor shall
operate wit an address space of 64 Kbytes or 4 Gbytes and it may only
be set to 1 (after a reset, it is set to 0 for compatibility with the
Z80). The LW flag in turn rules whether word operations shall work
with a word size of 16 or 32 bits. The setting of these two flags
influences range checks of constants and addresses, which is why one
has to tell AS the setting of these two flags via these instructions.
The default assumption is that both flags are 0, the current setting
(<TT>ON</TT> or<TT> OFF</TT>) may be read from the predefined

Intel substantially extended the 8051 instruction set with the
80C251, but unfortunately there was only a single free opcode for all
these new instructions. To avoid a processor that will be eternally
crippled by a prefix, Intel provided two operating modes: the binary
and the source mode. The new processor is fully binary compatible to
the 8051 in binary mode, all new instructions require the free opcode
as prefix. In source mode, the new instructions exchange their places
in the code tables with the corresponding 8051 instructions, which in
turn then need a prefix. One has to inform AS whether the processor
operates in source mode (<TT>ON</TT>) or binary mode (<TT>OFF</TT>)
to enable AS to add prefixes when required. The current setting may
be read from the variable<TT> INSRCMODE</TT>. The default is<TT>

Intel broke with its own principles when the 8051 series was
designed: in contrast to all traditions, the processor uses
big-endian ordering for all multi-byte values! While this was not a
big deal for MCS-51 processors (the processor could access memory
only in 8-bit portions, so everyone was free to use whichever
endianess one wanted), it may be a problem for the 251 as it can
fetch whole (long-)words from memory and expects the MSB to be first.
As this is not the way of constant disposal earlier versions of AS
used, one can use this instruction to toggle between big and little
endian mode for the instructions<TT> DB, DW, DD, DQ,</TT> and<TT>
DT</TT>.<TT> BIGENDIAN OFF</TT> (the default) puts the LSB first into
memory as it used to be on earlier versions of AS,<TT> BIGENDIAN

may of course change this setting as often as one wants; the current

After this switch has been set to<TT> ON</TT>, AS will assume that
the processor's program counter does not have the full length of 16
bits given by the architecture, but instead a length that is exactly
sufficient to address the internal ROM. For example, in case of the
AT90S8515, this means 12 bits, corresponding to 4 Kwords or 8 Kbytes.
This assumption allows relative branches from the ROM's beginning to
the end and vice versa which would result in an out-of-branch error
when using strict arithmetics. Here, they work because the carry bits
resulting from the target address computation are discarded. Assure
that the target processor you are using works in the outlined way
before you enable this option! In case of the abovementioned
AT90S8515, this option is even necessary because it is the only way

<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
Some microcontrollers and signal processors know various address
ranges, which do not overlap with each other and require also
different instructions and addressing modes for access. To manage
these ones also, the assembler provides various program counters, you
can switch among them to and from by the use of the<TT> SEGMENT</TT>
instruction. For subroutines included with<TT> INCLUDE</TT>, this
e.g. allows to define data used by the main program or subroutines
near to the place they are used. In detail, the following segments
with the following names are supported:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>CODE</TT>: program code;</LI>
<LI> <TT>DATA</TT>: directly addressable data (including SFRs);</LI>
<LI> <TT>XDATA</TT>: data in externally connected RAM or X-addressing
    space of the DSP56xxx or ROM data for the &micro;PD772x;</LI>
<LI> <TT>YDATA</TT>: Y-addressing space of the DSP56xxx;</LI>
<LI> <TT>IDATA</TT>: indirectly addressable (internal) data;</LI>

<LI> <TT>IO</TT>: I/O-address range;</LI>
<LI> <TT>REG</TT>: register bank of the ST9;</LI>
<LI> <TT>ROMDATA</TT>: constant ROM of the NEC signal processors.</LI>
</UL>
See also section <A HREF="#ref_SectORG">3.2.1</A> (<TT>ORG</TT>) for
detailed information about address ranges and initial values of the
segments. Depending on the processor family, not all segment types
will be permitted.
<P>
The bit segment is managed as if it would be a byte segment, i.e. the
addresses will be incremented by 1 per bit.
<P>
Labels get the same type as attribute as the segment that was active
when the label was defined. So the assembler has a limited ability to
check whether you access symbols of a certain segment with wrong
instructions. In such cases the assembler issues a warning.

<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
For some applications (especially on Z80 systems), the code must be
moved to another address range before execution. If the assembler
didn't know about this, it would align all labels to the load address
(not the start address). The programmer is then forced to write jumps
within this area either independent of location or has to add the
offset at each symbol manually. The first one is not possible for
some processors, the last one is extremely error-prone. With the
commands<TT> PHASE</TT> and<TT> DEPHASE</TT>, it is possible to
inform the assembler at which address the code will really be
executed on the target system:
<PRE>

        phase   &lt;address&gt;

</PRE>
informs the assembler that the following code shall be executed at
the specified address. The assembler calculates thereupon the
difference to the real program counter and adds this difference for
the following operations:
<UL>
<LI> address values in the listing</LI>
<LI> filing of label values</LI>
<LI> program counter references in relative jumps and address
    expressions</LI>
<LI> readout of the program counter via the symbols * or $</LI>
</UL>
this ''shifting'' is switched off by the instruction
<PRE>

        dephase

The assembler manages phase values for all defined segments, although
this instruction pair only makes real sense in the code segment.

<A NAME="index_SAVE_1"></A><A NAME="index_RESTORE_1"></A>
<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>

The command<TT> SAVE</TT> forces the assembler to push the contents
of following variables onto an internal stack:
<UL>
<LI> currently selected processor type (set by<TT> CPU</TT>);</LI>
<LI> currently active memory area (set by<TT> SEGMENT</TT>);</LI>
<LI> the flag whether listing is switched on or off (set by<TT>

<LI> the flag whether expansions of following macros shall be issued in
    the assembly listing (set by<TT> MACEXP</TT>).</LI>
<LI> currently active character translation table (set by<TT>
    CODEPAGE</TT>).</LI>
</UL>
The counterpart<TT> RESTORE</TT> pops the values saved last from this
stack. These two commands were primarily designed for include files,
to change the above mentioned variables in any way inside of these
files, without loosing their original content. This may be helpful
e.g. in include files with own, fully debugged subroutines, to switch
the listing generation off:
<PRE>

        SAVE            ; save old status 

        LISTING OFF     ; save paper 

        .               ; the actual code
        .

        RESTORE         ; restore

</PRE>
In opposite to a simple<TT> LISTING OFF .. ON</TT>-pair, the correct
status will be restored, in case the listing generation was switched
off already before.
<P>
The assembler checks if the number of<TT> SAVE</TT>-and<TT>
RESTORE</TT>-commands corresponds and issues error messages in the
following cases:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>RESTORE</TT>, but the internal stack is empty;</LI>

This instruction allows to tell AS the current setting of certain

addressing modes and whose contents are important to know for AS in
order to generate correct addressing. It is important to note
that<TT> ASSUME</TT> only informs AS about these,<B> no</B> machine
code is generated that actually loads these values into the

<H4>6809</H4>

In contrast to its 'predecessors' like the 6800 and 6502, the
position of the direct page, i.e. the page of memory that can be
reached with single-byte addresses, can be set freely. This is done
via the 'direct page register' that sets the page number. One has to
assign a corresponding value to this register via<TT> ASSUME</TT> is
the contents are different from the default of 0, otherwise wrong
addresses will be generated!
<P>

<H4>68HC11K4</H4>
<P>
Also for the HC11, the designers finally weren't able to avoid the
major sin: using a banking scheme to address more than 64 Kbytes with
only 16 address lines. The registers<TT> MMSIZ</TT>,<TT>
MMWBR</TT>,<TT> MM1CR</TT>, and<TT> MM2CR</TT> control whether and
how the additional 512K address ranges are mapped into the physical
address space. AS intially assumes the reset state of these
registers, i.e. all are set to $00 and windowing is disabled.
<P>

<H4>68HC12X</H4>
<P>
Similar to its cousin without the appended 'X', the HC12X supports a
short direct addressing mode. In this case however, it can be used to
address more than just the first 256 bytes of the address space.
The<TT> DIRECT</TT> register specifices which 256 byte page of the
address space is addressed by this addressing mode.<TT> ASSUME</TT>
is used to tell AS the current value of this register, so it is able
to automatically select the most efficient address ing mode when
absolute addresses are used. The default is 0, which corresponds to
the reset state.
<P>

<H4>68HC16</H4>
<P>
The 68HC16 employs a set of bank registers to address a space of 1
Mbyte with its registers that are only 16 bits wide. These registers
supply the upper 4 bits. Of these, the EK register is responsible for
absolute data accesses (not jumps!). AS checks for each absolute
address whether the upper 4 bits of the address are equal to the
value of EK specified via<TT> ASSUME</TT>. AS issues a warning if
they differ. The default for EK is 0.
<P>

<H4>H8/500</H4>
<P>
In maximum mode, the extended address space of these processors is
addressed via a couple of bank registers. They carry the names DP
(registers from 0..3, absolute addresses), EP (register 4 and 5), and
TP (stack). AS needs the current value of DP to check if absolute
addresses are within the currently addressable bank; the other two
registers are only used for indirect addressing and can therefore not
be monitored; it is a question of personal taste whether one
specifies their values or not. The BR register is in contrast
important because it rules which 256-byte page may be accessed with
short addresses. It is common for all registers that AS does not
assume<B> any</B> default value for them as they are undefined after
a CPU reset. Everyone who wants to use absolute addresses must
therefore assign values to at least DR and DP!
<P>

<H4>MELPS740</H4>
<P>
Microcontrollers of this series know a ''special page'' addressing
mode for the<TT> JSR</TT> instruction that allows a shorter coding
for jumps into the last page of on-chip ROM. The size of this ROM
depends of course on the exact processor type, and there are more
derivatives than it would be meaningful to offer via the CPU
instruction...we therefore have to rely on<TT> ASSUME</TT> to define
the address of this page, e.g.
<PRE>

        ASSUME  SP:$1f

</PRE>
in case the internal ROM is 8K.
<P>

<H4>MELPS7700/65816</H4>

These processors contain a lot of registers whose contents AS has to
know in order to generate correct machine code. These are the

</CENTER>
<P>
To avoid endless repetitions, see section <A
HREF="#ref_MELPS7700Spec">4.9</A> for instructions how to use these
registers. The handling is otherwise similar to the 8086, i.e.
multiple values may be set with one instruction and no code is
generated that actually loads the registers with the given values.
This is again up to the programmer!
<P>

<H4>MCS-196/296</H4>
<P>
Starting with the 80196, all processors of the MCS-96 family have a
register 'WSR' that allows to map memory areas from the extended
internal RAM or the SFR range into areas of the register file which
may then be accessed with short addresses. If one informs AS about
the value of the WSR register, it can automatically find out whether
an absolute address can be addressed with a single-byte address via
windowing; consequently, long addresses will be automatically
generated for registers covered by windowing. The 80296 contains an
additional register WSR1 to allow simultaneous mapping of two memory
areas into the register file. In case it is possible to address a
memory cell via both areas, AS will always choose the way via WSR!
<P>

<H4>8086</H4>
<P>
The 8086 is able to address data from all segments in all
instructions, but it however needs so-called ''segment prefixes'' if
another segment register than DS shall be used. In addition it is
possible that the DS register is adjusted to another segment, e.g. to
address data in the code segment for longer parts of the program. As
AS cannot analyze the code's meaning, it has to informed via this
instruction to what segments the segment registers point at the
moment, e.g.:
<PRE>

        ASSUME  CS:CODE, DS:DATA    .

</PRE>
It is possible to assign assumptions to all four segment registers in
this way. This instruction produces<B> no</B> code, so the program
itself has to do the actual load of the registers with the values.
<P>
The usage of this instruction has on the one hand the result that AS
is able to automatically put ahead prefixes at sporadic accesses into
the code segment, or on the other hand, one can inform AS that the
DS-register was modified and you can save explicit<TT>
CS:</TT>-instructions.
<P>
Valid arguments behind the colon are<TT> CODE</TT>,<TT> DATA</TT>
and<TT> NOTHING</TT>. The latter value informs AS that a segment
register contains no usable value (for AS). The following values are
preinitialized:
<PRE>

  CS:CODE, DS:DATA, ES:NOTHING, SS:NOTHING

</PRE>
<P>

<H4>XA</H4>
<P>
The XA family has a data address space of 16 Mbytes, a process
however can always address within a 64K segment only that is given by
the DS register. One has to inform AS about the current value of this
register in order to enable it to check accesses to absolute
addresses.
<P>

<H4>29K</H4>
<P>
The processors of the 29K family feature a register RBP that allows
to protect banks of 16 registers against access from user mode. The
corresponding bit has to be set to achieve the protection.<TT>
ASSUME</TT> allows to tell AS which value RBP currently contains. AS
can warn this way in case a try to access protected registers from
user mode is made.
<P>

<H4>80C166/167</H4>
<P>
Though none of the 80C166/167's registers is longer than sixteen
bits, this processor has 18/24 address lines and can therefore
address up to 256Kbytes/16Mbytes. To resolve this contradiction, it
neither uses the well-known (and ill-famed) Intel method of
segmentation nor does it have inflexible bank registers...no, it uses
paging! To accomplish this, the logical address space of 64 Kbytes is
split into 4 pages of 16 Kbytes, and for each page there is a page
register (named DPP0..DPP3) that rules which of the 16/1024 physical
pages shall be mapped to this logical page. AS always tries to
present the address space with a size of 256Kbytes/16MBytes in the
sight of the programmer, i.e. the physical page is taken for absolute
accesses and the setting of bits 14/15 of the logical address is
deduced. If no page register fits, a warning is issued. AS assumes by
default that the four registers linearly map the first 64 Kbytes of
memory, in the following style:
<PRE>

        ASSUME  DPP0:0,DPP1:1,DPP2:2,DPP3:3

</PRE>
The 80C167 knows some additional instructions that can override the
page registers' function. The chapter with processor-specific hints
describes how these instructions influence the address generation.
<P>

<H4>TLCS-47</H4>
<P>
The direct data address space of these processors (it makes no
difference whether you address directly or via the HL register) has a
size of only 256 nibbles. Because the ''better'' family members have
up to 1024 nibbles of RAM on chip, Toshiba was forced to introduce a
banking mechanism via the DMB register. AS manages the data segment
as a continuous addressing space and checks at any direct addressing
if the address is in the currently active bank. The bank AS currently
expects can be set by means of
<PRE>

        ASSUME  DMB:&lt;0..3&gt;

</PRE>
The default value is 0.
<P>

<H4>ST6</H4>
<A NAME="ref_ST6Assume"></A>
<P>
The microcontrollers of the ST62 family are able to map a part (64
bytes) of the code area into the data area, e.g. to load constants
from the ROM. This means also that at one moment only one part of the
ROM can be addressed. A special register rules which part it is. AS
cannot check the contents of this register directly, but it can be
informed by this instruction that a new value has been assigned to
the register. AS then can test and warn if necessary, in case
addresses of the code segment are accessed, which are not located in
the ''announced'' window. If, for example, the variable<TT> VARI</TT>
has the value 456h, so
<PRE>

        ASSUME  ROMBASE:VARI&gt;&gt;6

</PRE>
sets the AS-internal variable to 11h, and an access to<TT> VARI</TT>
generates an access to address 56h in the data segment.
<P>
It is possible to assign a simple<TT> NOTHING</TT> instead of a
value, e.g. if the bank register is used temporarily as a memory
cell. This value is also the default.
<P>

<H4>ST9</H4>
<P>
The ST9 family uses exactly the same instructions to address code and
data area. It depends on the setting of the flag register's DP flag
which address space is referenced. To enable AS to check if one works
with symbols from the correct address space (this of course<B>
only</B> works with absolute accesses!), one has to inform AS whether
the DP flag is currently 0 (code) or 1 (data). The initial value of
this assumption is 0.
<P>

<H4>78K2</H4>
<P>
78K2 is an 8/16 bit architecture, which has later been extended to a
one-megabyte addres space via banking. Banking is realized with the
registers PM6 (normal case) resp. P6 (alternate case with &amp; as
prefix) that supply the missing upper four address bits. At least for
absolute addresses, AS can check whether the current, linear 20-bit
address is within the given 64K window.
<P>

<H4>320C3x</H4>
<P>
As all instruction words of this processor family are only 32 bits
long (of which only 16 bits were reserved for absolute addresses),
the missing upper 8 bits have to be added from the DP register. It is
however still possible to specify a full 24-bit address when
addressing, AS will check then whether the upper 8 bits are equal to
the DP register's assumed values.<TT> ASSUME</TT> is different to
the<TT> LDP</TT> instruction in the sense that one cannot specify an
arbitrary address out of the bank in question, one has to extract the
upper bits by hand:
<PRE>

        ldp     @addr
        assume  dp:addr&gt;&gt;16
        .
        .
        ldi     @addr,r2

</PRE>
<P>

<H4>&micro;PD78(C)10</H4>
<P>
These processors have a register (V) that allows to move the ''zero
page'', i.e. page of memory that is addressable by just one byte,
freely in the address space, within page limits. By reasons of
comforts you don't want to work with expressions such as
<PRE>

        inrw    Lo(counter)

</PRE>
so AS takes over this job, but only under the premise that it is
informed via the<TT> ASSUME</TT>-command about the contents of the V
register. If an instruction with short addressing is used, it will be
checked if the upper half of the address expression corresponds to
the expected content. A warning will be issued if both do not match.
<P>

<H4>75K0</H4>
<P>
As the whole address space of 12 bits could not be addressed even by
the help of register pairs (8 bits), NEC had to introduce banking
(like many others too...): the upper 4 address bits are fetched from
the MBS register (which can be assigned values from 0 to 15 by
the<TT> ASSUME</TT> instruction), which however will only be regarded
if the MBE flag has been set to 1. If it is 0 (default), the lowest
and highest 128 nibbles of the address space can be reached without
banking. The<TT> ASSUME</TT> instruction is undefined for the 75402
as it contains neither a MBE flag nor an MBS register; the initial
values cannot be changed therefore.
<P>

<H4>F&sup2;MC16L</H4>
<P>
Similar to many other families of microcontrollers, this family
suffers somewhat from its designers miserliness: registers of only 16
bits width are faced with an address space of 24 bits. Once again,
bank registers had to fill the gap. In detail, these are PCB for the
progam code, DTB for all data accesses, ADB for indirect accesses via
RW2/RW6, and SSB/USB for the stacks. They may all take values from 0
to 255 and are by default assumed to be 0, with the exception of 0ffh
for PCB.
<P>
Furthermore, a DPR register exists that specifies which memory page
within the 64K bank given by DTB may be reached with 8 bit addresses.
The default for DPR is 1, resulting in a default page of 0001xxh when
ine takes DTB's default into account.

AMD defined the 29000's series exception handling for undefined
instructions in a way that there is a separate exception vector for
each instruction. This allows to extend the instruction set of a
smaller member of this family by a software emulation. To avoid that
AS quarrels about these instructions as being undefined, the<TT>
EMULATED</TT> instruction allows to tell AS that certain instructions
are allowed in this case. The check if the currently set processors
knows the instruction is then skipped. For example, if one has
written a module that supports 32-bit IEEE numbers and the processor
does not have a FPU, one writes

<P>
<TT> BRANCHEXT</TT> with either<TT> ON</TT> or<TT> OFF</TT> as
argument tells AS whether short branches that are only available with
an 8-bit displacement shall automatically be 'extended', for example
by replacing a single instruction like
<PRE>

        bne     target

</PRE>
with a longer sequence of same functionality, in case the branc
target is out of reach for the instruction's displacement. For
example, the replacement sequence for<TT> bne</TT> would be
<PRE>

        beq     skip  
        jmp     target
skip:

</PRE>
In case there is no fitting 'opposite' for an instruction, the
sequence may become even longer, e.g. for<TT> jbc</TT>:
<PRE>

        jbc     dobr
        bra     skip
dobr:   jmp     target
skip:

This feature however has the side effect that there is no unambigious
assignment between machine and assembly code any more. Furthermore,
additional passes may be the result if there are forward branches.
One should therefore use this feature with caution!

<H2><A NAME="sect_3_3_">3.3. Data Definitions</A></H2>

The instructions described in this section partially overlap in their
functionality, but each processor family defines other names for the
same function. To stay compatible with the standard assemblers, this
way of implementation was chosen.

If not explicitly mentioned otherwise, all instructions for data
deposition (not those for reservation of memory!) allow an arbitrary
number of parameters which are being processed from left to right.

<EM> valid for: 680x0, M*Core, 68xx, H8, SH7x00, DSP56xxx, XA,
ST7</EM> This instruction places one or several constants of the type
specified by the attribute into memory. The attributes are the same
ones as defined in section <A HREF="#ref_AttrTypes">2.5</A>, and
there is additionally the possibility for byte constants to place
string constants in memory, like
<PRE>

String  dc.B "Hello world!\0"

</PRE>
The parameter count may be between 1 and 20. A repeat count enclosed
in brackets may additionally be prefixed to each parameter; for
example, one can for example fill the area up to the next page
boundary with zeroes with a statement like
<PRE>

        dc.b    [(*+255)&$ffffff00-*]0

</PRE>
<B>CAUTION!</B> This function easily allows to reach the limit of 1
Kbyte of generated code per line!
<P>
The assembler can automatically add another byte of data in case the
byte sum should become odd, to keep the word alignment. This
behaviour may be turned on and off via the<TT> PADDING</TT>
instruction.
<P>
Decimal floating point numbers stored with this instruction
(<TT>DC.P...</TT>) can cover the whole range of extended precision,
one however has to pay attention to the detail that the coprocessors
currently available from Motorola (68881/68882) ignore the thousands
digit of the exponent at the read of such constants!
<P>
The default attribute is<TT> W</TT>, that means 16-bit-integer
numbers.
<P>
For the DSP56xxx, the data type is fixed to integer numbers (an
attribute is therefore neither necessary nor allowed), which may be
in the range of -8M up to 16M-1. String constants are also allowed,
whereby three characters are packed into each word.
<P>
Opposed to the standar Motorola ssembler, it is also valid to reserve
memory space with this statement, by using a question mark as
operand. This is an extension added by some third-party suppliers for
68K assemblers, similar to what Intel assemblers provide. However, it
should be clear that usage of this feature may lead to portability
problems. Furthermore, question marks as operands must not be mixed
with 'normal' constants in a single statement.

<P>
On the one hand, this instruction enables to reserve memory space for
the specified count of numbers of the type given by the attribute.
Therefore,
<PRE>

        DS.B    20

</PRE>
for example reserves 20 bytes of memory, but
<PRE>

        DS.X    20

</PRE>
reserves 240 bytes!
<P>
The other purpose is the alignment of the program counter which is
achieved by a count specification of 0. In this way, with a
<PRE>

        DS.W    0  ,

</PRE>
the program counter will be rounded up to the next even address, with
a
<PRE>

        DS.D 0

</PRE>
in contrast to the next double word boundary. Memory cells possibly
staying unused thereby are neither zeroed nor filled with NOPs, they
simply stay undefined.
<P>
The default for the operand length is - as usual -<TT> W</TT>, i.e.
16 bits.
<P>
For the 56xxx, the operand length is fixed to words (of 24 bit),
attributes therefore do not exist just as in the case of<TT> DC</TT>.

<P>
These commands are - one could say - the Intel counterpart to<TT>
DS</TT> and<TT> DC</TT>, and as expected, their logic is a little bit
different: First, the specification of the operand length is moved
into the mnemonic:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>DB</TT>: byte or ASCII string similar to<TT> DC.B</TT></LI>
<LI> <TT>DW</TT>: 16-bit integer</LI>
<LI> <TT>DD</TT>: 32-bit integer or single precision</LI>
<LI> <TT>DQ</TT>: double precision (64 bits)</LI>
<LI> <TT>DT</TT>: extended precision (80 bits)</LI>
</UL>
Second, the distinction between constant definition and memory
reservation is done by the operand. A reservation of memory is marked
by a<TT> ?</TT> :
<PRE>

        db      ?       ; reserves a byte
        dw      ?,?     ; reserves memory for 2 words (=4 byte)
        dd      -1      ; places the constant -1 (FFFFFFFFH) !

</PRE>
Reserved memory and constant definition<B> must not</B> be mixed
within one instruction:
<PRE>

        db      "hello",?       ; --&gt; error message

</PRE>
Additionally, the<TT> DUP</TT> Operator permits the repeated placing
of constant sequences or the reservation of whole memory blocks:
<PRE>

        db      3 dup (1,2)     ; --&gt; 1 2 1 2 1 2
        dw      20 dup (?)      ; reserves 40 bytes of memory

</PRE>
As you can see, the<TT> DUP</TT>-argument must be enclosed in
parentheses, which is also why it may consist of several components,
that may themselves be<TT> DUP</TT>s...the stuff therefore works
recursively.<TT> DUP</TT> is however also a place where one can get
in touch with another limit of the assembler: a maximum of 1024 bytes
of code or data may be generated in one line. This is not valid for
the reservation of memory, only for the definition of constant
arrays!
<P>
In order to be compatible to the M80,<TT> DEFB/DEFW</TT> may be used
instead of<TT> DB/DW</TT> in Z80-mode.
<P>
Similarly,<TT> BYTE/ADDR</TT> resp.<TT> WORD/ADDRW</TT> in COP4/8
mode are an alias for<TT> DB</TT> resp.<TT> DW</TT>, with the pairs
differing in byte order: instructions defined by National for address
storage use big endian,<TT> BYTE</TT> resp.<TT> WORD</TT> in contrast
use little endian.
<P>
The NEC 77230 is special with its<TT> DW</TT> instruction: It more
works like the<TT> DATA</TT> statement of its smaller brothers, but
apart from string and integer arguments, it also accepts floating
point values (and stores them in the processor's proprietary 32-bit
format). There is<EM> no</EM><TT> DUP</TT> operator!

Another three floating point commands. All of them support non-IEEE

The three commands share a common storage strategy. In all cases the
mantissa precedes the exponent in memory, both are stored as 2's
complement with the least significant byte first. Note that when in

This command stores data in the current segment. Both integer values
as well as character strings are supported. On 16C5x/16C8x, 17C4x in

17C4x in code segment, &micro;PD772x in the data segments, and on

The &micro;PD77C25 can hold three bytees per word in the code
segment. When in 320C3x, mode the assembler puts four characters into
one word (MSB first). In contrast to this characters occupy two
memory locations in the data segment of the 4500, similar in the
4004. The range of integer values corresponds to the word width of
each processor in a specific segment. This means that<TT> DATA</TT>

This command allocates memory. When used in code segments the
argument counts words (10/12/14/16 bit). In data segments it counts
bytes for PICs, nibbles for 4500's and words for the TI devices.

<TT> BSS</TT> works like<TT> RES</TT>, but when in 320C2(0)x/5x mode,
the assembler assumes that a label on the left side of this

Although the SH7000 processor can do an immediate register load with

instead simulated through constants in memory. Storing them in the
code segment (not far away from the register load instruction) would
require an additional jump. AS Therefore gathers the constants an
stores them at an address specified by<TT> LTORG</TT>. Details are

<H2><A NAME="sect_3_4_">3.4. Macro Instructions</A></H2>
<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
Now we finally reach the things that make a macro assembler different
from an ordinary assembler: the ability to define macros (guessed it
!?).
<P>
When speaking about 'macros', I generally mean a sequence of (machine
or pseudo) instructions which are united to a block by special
statements and can then be treated in certain ways. The assembler
knows the following statements to work with such blocks:
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_1_">3.4.1. MACRO</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_MACRO_1"></A><A NAME="index_ENDM_1"></A>
<P>
is probably the most important instruction for macro programming. The
instruction sequence
<PRE>

&lt;name&gt;  MACRO   [parameter list]
        &lt;instructions&gt;
        ENDM

</PRE>
defines the macro<TT> &lt;name&gt;</TT> to be the enclosed
instruction sequence. This definition by itself does not generate any
code! In turn, from now on the instruction sequence can simply be
called by the name, the whole construct therefore shortens and
simplifies programs. A parameter list may be added to the macro
definition to make things even more useful. The parameters' names
have to be separated by commas (as usual) and have to conform to the
conventions for symbol names (see section <A
HREF="#ref_SectSymConv">2.7</A>) - like the macro name itself.
<P>
A switch to case-sensitive mode influences both macro names and
parameters.
<P>
Similar to symbols, macros are local, i.e. they are only known in a
section and its subsections when the definition is done from within a
section. This behaviour however can be controlled in wide limits via
the options<TT> PUBLIC</TT> and<TT> GLOBAL</TT> described below.
<P>
Apart from the macro parameters themselves, the parameter list may
contain control parameters which influence the processing of the
macro. These parameters are distinguished from normal parameters by
being enclosed in braces. The following control parameters are
defined:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>EXPAND/NOEXPAND</TT>: rule whether the enclosed code shall be
    written to the listing when the macro is expanded. The default is
    the value set by the pseudo instruction<TT> MACEXP</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>PUBLIC[:section name]</TT>: assigns the macro to a parent
    section instead of the current section. A section can make macros
    accessible for the outer code this way. If the section
    specification is missing, the macro becomes completely global,
    i.e. it may be referenced from everywhere.</LI>
<LI> <TT>GLOBAL[:section name]</TT>: rules that in addition to the macro
    itself, another macro shall be generated that has the same
    contents but is assigned to the specified section. Its name is
    constructed by concatenating the current section's name to the
    macro name. The section specified must be a parent section of the
    current section; if the specification is missing, the additional
    macro becomes globally visible. For example, if a macro<TT>
    A</TT> is defined in a section<TT> B</TT> that is a child section
    of section<TT> C</TT>, an additional global macro named<TT>
    C_B_A</TT> would be generated. In contrast, if<TT> C</TT> had
    been specified as target section, the macro would be named<TT>
    B_A</TT> and be assigned to section<TT> C</TT>. This option is
    turned off by default and it only has an effect when it is used
    from within a section. The macro defined locally is not
    influenced by this option.</LI>
<LI> <TT>EXPORT/NOEXPORT</TT>: rules whether the definition of this macro
    shall be written to a separate file in case the<TT> -M</TT>
    command line option was given. This way, definitions of 'private'
    macros may be mapped out selectively. The default is FALSE, i.e.
    the definition will not be written to the file. The macro will be
    written with the concatenated name if the<TT> GLOBAL</TT> option
    was additionally present.</LI>
<LI> <TT>INTLABEL/NOINTLABEL</TT> : rules whether a label defined in a
    line that calls this macro may be used as an additional parameter
    inside the label or not, instead of simply 'labeling' the
    line.</LI>
</UL>
The control parameters described above are removed from the parameter
list by AS, i.e. they do not have a further influence on processing
and usage.
<P>
When a macro is called, the parameters given for the call are
textually inserted into the instruction block and the resulting
assembler code is assembled as usual. Zero length parameters are
inserted in case too few parameters are specified. It is important to
note that string constants are not protected from macro expansions.
The old IBM rule:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <I> It's not a bug, it's a feature!</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
applies for this detail. The gap was left to allow checking of
parameters via string comparisons. For example, one can analyze a
macro parameter in the following way:
<PRE>

mul     MACRO   para,parb
        IF      UpString("PARA")&lt;&gt;"A"
         MOV    a,para
        ENDIF
        IF      UpString("PARB")&lt;&gt;"B"
         MOV    b,parb
        ENDIF
        mul     ab
        ENDM

</PRE>
It is important for the example above that the assembler converts all
parameter names to upper case when operating in case-insensitive
mode, but this conversion never takes place inside of string
constants. Macro parameter names therefore have to be written in
upper case when they appear in string constants.
<P>
The same naming rules as for usual symbols also apply for macro
parameters, with the exception that only letters and numbers are
allowed, i.e. dots and underscores are forbidden. This constraint has
its reason in a hidden feature: the underscore allows to concatenate
macro parameter names to a symbol, like in the following example:
<PRE>

concat  macro   part1,part2
        call    part1_part2
        endm

</PRE>
The call
<PRE>

        concat  module,function

</PRE>
will therefore result in
<PRE>

        call    module_function

</PRE>
Apart from the parameters explicitly declared for a macro, four more
'implicitly' declared parameters exist. Since they are always
present, they cannot not be redeclared as explicit parameters:
<UL>
<LI> <TT> ATTRIBUTE</TT> refers to the attribute appended to the macro
    call, in case the currently active architecture supports
    attributes for machine instructions. See below for an
    example!</LI>
<LI> <TT> ALLARGS</TT> refers to a comma-separated list of all arguments
    passed to a macro, usable e.g. to pass them on to a IRP
    statement.</LI>
<LI> <TT> ARGCOUNT</TT> refers to the actual count of parameters passed
    to a macro. Note however that this number is never lower than the
    formal parameter count of the macro, since AS will fill up
    missing arguments with empty strings!</LI>
<LI> <TT> __LABEL__</TT> refers to a label present in a line that calls
    the macro. This replacement only takes place if the<TT>
    INTLABEL</TT> option was set for this macro!</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The purpose of being able to 'internally' use a label in a macro is
surely not immediately obvious. There might be cases where moving the
macro's entry point into its body may be useful. The most important
application however are TI signal processors that use a double pipe
symbol in the label's column to mark parallelism, like this:
<PRE>

    instr1
||  instr2

</PRE>
(since both instructions merge into a single word of machine code,
you cannot branch to the second instruction - so occupying the
label's position doesn't hurt). The problem is however that some
'convenience instructions' are realized as macros. A prallelization
symbol written in front of a macro call normally would be assigned to
the macro itself,<I> not to the macro body's first instruction</I>.
However, things work with this trick:
<PRE>

myinstr    macro {INTLABEL}
__LABEL__  instr2
           endm  

           instr1
||         myinstr

</PRE>
The result after expanding<TT> myinstr</TT> is identical to the
previous example without macro.
<P>
Recursion of macros, i.e. the repeated call of a macro from within
its own body is completely legal. However, like for any other sort of
recursion, one has to assure that there is an end at someplace. For
cases where one forgot this, AS keeps an internal counter for every
macro that is incremented when an expansion of this macro is begun
and decremented again when the expansion is completed. In case of
recursive calls, this counter reaches higher and higher values, and
at a limit settable via<TT> NESTMAX</TT>, AS will refuse to expand.
Be careful when you turn off this emergency brake: the memory
consumption on the heap may go beyond all limits and even shut down a
Unix system...
<P>
A small example to remove all clarities ;-)
<P>
A programmer braindamaged by years of programming Intel processors
wants to have the instructions<TT> PUSH/POP</TT> also for the 68000.
He solves the 'problem' in the following way:
<PRE>

push    macro   op
        move.ATTRIBUTE op,-(sp)
        endm

pop     macro   op
        move.ATTRIBUTE (sp)+,op
        endm

</PRE>
If one writes
<PRE>

        push    d0
        pop.l   a2    ,

</PRE>
this results in
<PRE>

        move.   d0,-(sp)
        move.l  (sp)+,a2

</PRE>
A macro definition must not cross include file boundaries.
<P>
Labels defined in macros always are regarded as being local, an
explicit<TT> LOCAL</TT> instruction is therefore not necessary (it
even does not exist). In case there is a reason to make a label
global, one may define it with<TT> LABEL</TT> which always creates
global symbols (similar to<TT> BIT, SFR...</TT>):
<PRE>

&lt;Name&gt;  label   $

</PRE>
When parsing a line, the assembler first checks the macro list
afterwards looks for processor instructions, which is why macros
allow to redefine processor instructions. However, the definition
should appear previously to the first invocation of the instruction
to avoid phase errors like in the following example:
<PRE>

        bsr     target

bsr     macro   targ
        jsr     targ
        endm

        bsr     target

</PRE>
In the first pass, the macro is not known when the first<TT> BSR</TT>
instruction is assembled; an instruction with 4 bytes of length is
generated. In the second pass however, the macro definition is
immediately available (from the first pass), a<TT> JSR</TT> of 6
bytes length is therefore generated. As a result, all labels
following are too low by 2 and phase errors occur for them. An
additional pass is necessary to resolve this.
<P>
Because a machine or pseudo instruction becomes hidden when a macro
of same name is defined, there is a backdoor to reach the original
meaning: the search for macros is suppressed if the name is prefixed
with an exclamation mark (!). This may come in handy if one wants to
extend existing instructions in their functionality, e.g. the
TLCS-90's shift instructions:
<PRE>

srl     macro   op,n            ; shift by n places
        rept    n               ; n simple instructions   
         !srl   op
        endm
        endm

</PRE>
From now on, the<TT> SRL</TT> instruction has an additional
parameter...
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_2_">3.4.2. IRP</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_IRP_1"></A>
<P>
is a simplified macro definition for the case that an instruction
sequence shall be applied to a couple of operands and the the code is
not needed any more afterwards.<TT> IRP</TT> needs a symbol for the
operand as its first parameter, and an (almost) arbitrary number of
parameters that are sequentially inserted into the block of code. For
example, one can write
<PRE>

        irp     op, acc,b,dpl,dph
        push    op
        endm

</PRE>
to push a couple of registers to the stack, what results in
<PRE>

        push    acc
        push    b  
        push    dpl
        push    dph

</PRE>
Again, labels used are automatically local for every pass.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_3_">3.4.3. IRPC</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_IRPC_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> IRPC</TT> is a variant of<TT> IRP</TT> where the first
argument's occurences in the lines up to<TT> ENDM</TT> are
successively replaced by the characters of a string instead of
further parameters. For example, an especially complicated way of
placing a string into memory would be:
<PRE>

        irpc    char,"Hello World"
        db      'CHAR'
        endm

</PRE>
<B>CAUTION!</B> As the example already shows,<TT> IRPC</TT> only
inserts the pure character; it is the programmer's task to assure
that valid code results (in this example by inserting quotes,
including the detail that no automatic conversion to uppercase
characters is done).
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_4_">3.4.4. REPT</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_REPT_1"></A>
<P>
is the simplest way to employ macro constructs. The code between<TT>
REPT</TT> and<TT> ENDM</TT> is assembled as often as the integer
argument of<TT> REPT</TT> specifies. This statement is commonly used
in small loops to replace a programmed loop to save the loop
overhead.
<P>
An example for the sake of completeness:
<PRE>

        rept    3
        rr      a
        endm

</PRE>
rotates the accumulator to the right by three digits.
<P>
In case<TT> REPT</TT>'s argument is equal to or smaller than 0, no
expansion at all is done. This is different to older versions of AS
which used to be a bit 'sloppy' in this respect and always made a
single expansion.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_5_">3.4.5. WHILE</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_WHILE_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> WHILE</TT> operates similarly to<TT> REPT</TT>, but the fixed
number of repetitions given as an argument is replaced by a boolean
expression. The code framed by<TT> WHILE</TT> and<TT> ENDM</TT> is
assembled until the expression becomes logically false. This may mean
in the extreme case that the enclosed code is not assembled at all in
case the expression was already false when the construct was found.
On the other hand, it may happen that the expression stays true
forever and AS will run infinitely...one should apply therefore a bit
of accuracy when one uses this construct, i.e. the code must contain
a statement that influences the condition, e.g. like this:
<PRE>

cnt     set     1
sq      set     cnt*cnt
        while   sq&lt;=1000
         dc.l    sq
cnt      set     cnt+1
sq       set     cnt*cnt
        endm

</PRE>
This example stores all square numbers up to 1000 to memory.
<P>
Currently there exists a little ugly detail for<TT> WHILE</TT>: an
additional empty line that was not present in the code itself is
added after the last expansion. This is a 'side effect' based on a
weakness of the macro processor and it is unfortunately not that easy
to fix. I hope noone minds...
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_6_">3.4.6. EXITM</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_EXITM_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> EXITM</TT> offers a way to terminate a macro expansion or one of
the instructions<TT> REPT, IRP,</TT> or<TT> WHILE</TT> prematurely.
Such an option helps for example to replace encapsulations with<TT>
IF-ENDIF</TT>-ladders in macros by something more readable. Of
course, an<TT> EXITM</TT> itself always has to be conditional, what
leads us to an important detail: When an<TT> EXITM</TT> is executed,
the stack of open<TT> IF</TT> and<TT> SWITCH</TT> constructs is reset
to the state it had just before the macro expansion started. This is
imperative for conditional<TT> EXITM</TT>'s as the<TT> ENDIF</TT>
resp.<TT> ENDCASE</TT> that frames the<TT> EXITM</TT> statement will
not be reached any more; AS would print an error message without this
trick. Please keep also in mind that<TT> EXITM</TT> always only
terminates the innermost construct if macro constructs are nested! If
one want to completely break out of a nested construct, one has to
use additional<TT> EXITM</TT>'s on the higher levels!
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_7_">3.4.7. SHIFT</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_SHIFT_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> SHIFT</TT> is a tool to construct macros with variable argument
lists: it discards the first parameter, with the result that the
second parameter takes its place and so on. This way one could
process a variable argument list...if you do it the right way. For
example, the following does not work...
<PRE>
   
pushlist  macro reg
          rept  ARGCOUNT
          push  reg
          shift
          endm
          endm

</PRE>
...because the macro gets expanded<TT> once</TT>, its output is
captured by<TT> REPT</TT> and then executed n times. Therefore, the
first argument is saved n times...the following approach works
better:
<PRE>

pushlist  macro reg
          if      "ARG"&lt;&gt;""
           push    arg
           shift
           pushlist ALLARGS
          endif
          endm 

</PRE>
Effectively, this is a recursion that shortens the argument list once
per step. The important trick is that a new macro expansion is
started in each step...
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_8_">3.4.8. MAXNEST</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_MAXNEST_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> MAXNEST</TT> allows to adjust how often a mcro may be called
recursively before AS terminates with an error message. The argument
may be an arbitrary positive integer value, with the special value 0
turning the this security brake completely off (be careful with
that...). The default value for the maximum nesting level is 256; its
current value may be read from the integer symbol of same name.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_4_9_">3.4.9. FUNCTION</A></H3>
<A NAME="ref_SectFUNCTION"></A><A NAME="index_FUNCTION_1"></A>
<P>
Though<TT> FUNCTION</TT> is not a macro statement in the inner sense,
I will describe this instruction at this place because it uses
similar principles like macro replacements.
<P>
This instruction is used to define new functions that may then be
used in formula expressions like predefined functions. The definition
must have the following form:
<PRE>

&lt;name&gt;  FUNCTION &lt;arg&gt;,..,&lt;arg&gt;,&lt;expression&gt;

</PRE>
The arguments are the values that are 'fed into' the function. The
definition uses symbolic names for the arguments. The assembler knows
by this that where to insert the actual values when the function is
called. This can be seen from the following example:
<PRE>

isdigit FUNCTION ch,(ch&gt;='0')&&(ch&lt;='9')

</PRE>
This function checks whether the argument (interpreted as a
character) is a number in the currently valid character set (the
character set can be modified via<TT> CHARSET</TT>, therefore the
careful wording).
<P>
The arguments' names (<TT>CH</TT> in this case) must conform to the
stricter rules for macro parameter names, i.e. the special characters
. and _ are not allowed.
<P>
User-defined functions can be used in the same way as builtin
functions, i.e. with a list of parameters, separated by commas,
enclosed in parentheses:
<PRE>

        IF isdigit(char)
         message "\{char} is a number"
        ELSEIF
         message "\{char} is not a number"
        ENDIF

</PRE>
When the function is called, all parameters are calculated once and
are then inserted into the function's formula. This is done to reduce
calculation overhead and to avoid side effects. The individual
arguments have to be separated by commas when a function has more
than one parameter.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> Similar to macros, one can use user-defined
functions to override builtin functions. This is a possible source
for phase errors. Such definitions therefore should be done before
the first call!
<P>
The result's type may depend on the type of the input arguments as
the arguments are textually inserted into the function's formula. For
example, the function
<PRE>

double  function x,x+x

</PRE>
may have an integer, a float, or even a string as result, depending
on the argument's type!
<P>
When AS operates in case-sensitive mode, the case matters when
defining or referencing user-defined functions, in contrast to
builtin functions!

STRUCT</TT> and ends with<TT> ENDSTRUCT</TT> (lazy people may also
write<TT> STRUC</TT> resp.<TT> ENDS</TT> instead). A label preceding
these instructions is taken as the name of the structure to be
defined; it is optional at the end of the definition and may be used
to redefine the length symbol's name (see below). The remaining
procedure is simple: Together with<TT> STRUCT</TT>, the cuurent
program counter is saved and reset to zero. All labels defined
between<TT> STRUCT</TT> and<TT> ENDSTRUCT</TT> therefore are the
offsets of the structure's data fields. Reserving space is done via
the same instructions that are also otherwise used for reserving
space, like e.g.<TT> DS.x</TT> for Motorola CPUs or<TT> DB</TT> &amp;
co. for Intel-style processors. The rules for rounding up lengths to
assure certain alignments also apply here - if one wants to define
'packed' structures, a preceding<TT> PADDING OFF</TT> may be
necessary. Vice versa, alignments may be forced with<TT> ALIGN</TT>
or similar instructions.
<P>
Since such a definition only represents a sort of 'prototype', only
instructions that reserve memory may be used, no instructions that
dispose constants or generate code.
<P>
Labels defined inside structures (i.e. the elements' names) are not
stored as-is. Instead, the structure's name is prepended to them,
separated with a special character. By default, this is the underbar
(_). This behaviour however may be modified with two arguments passed
to the<TT> STRUCT</TT> statement:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>NOEXTNAMES</TT> suppressed the prepending of the structure's
    name. In this case, it is the programmer's responsibility to
    assure that field names are not used more than once.</LI>
<LI> <TT>DOTS</TT> instructs AS to use the dot as connecting character
    instead of the underbar. It should however be pointed out that on
    certain target architectures, the dot has a special meaning for
    bit addressing, which may lead to problems!</LI>
</UL>
It is futhermore possible to turn the usage of a dot on resp. off for
all following structures:
<PRE>

        dottedstructs &lt;on|off&gt;

</PRE>
<P>
Aside from the element names, AS also defines a further symbol with
the structure's overall length when the definition has been finished.
This symbol has the name<TT> LEN</TT>, which is being extended with
the structure's name via the same rules - or alternitavely with the
label name given with the<TT> ENDSTRUCT</TT> statement.
<P>
In practice, this may things may look like in this example:
<PRE>

Rec     STRUCT  
Ident   db      ?
Pad     db      ?
Pointer dd      ?
Rec     ENDSTRUCT

</PRE>
In this example, the symbol<TT> REC_LEN</TT> would be assigned the
value 6.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_5_2_">3.5.2. Usage</A></H3>
<P>
Once a structure has been assigned, usage is as simple as possible
and similar to a macro: a simple
<PRE>

thisrec Rec

</PRE>
reserves as much memory as needed to hold an instance of the
structure, and additionally defines a symbol for every element of the
structure with its address, in this case<TT> THISREC_IDENT,
THISREC_PAD</TT>, and<TT> THISREC_POINTER</TT>. A label naturally
must not be omitted when calling a structure; if it is missing, an
error will be emitted.
<P>
<B> ATTENTION!</B> Though AS does not expect any arguments when
calling a structure, any arguments given will simply be ignored and
not be reported as error. This is a precaution to allow the
definition of pre-initialized structures in the future.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_5_3_">3.5.3. Nested Structures</A></H3>
<P>
Is is perfectly valid to call an already defined structure within the
definition of another structure. The procedure that is taking place
then is a combination of the definition and calling described in the
previous two sections: elements of the substructure are being
defined, the name of the instance is being prepended, and the name of
the super-structure is once again geing prepended to this
concatenated name. This may look like the following:
<PRE>

TreeRec struct  
left    dd         ?
right   dd         ?
data    Rec
TreeRec endstruct

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_5_4_">3.5.4. Unions</A></H3>
<P>
A union is a special form of a structure whose elements are not laid
out sequentially in memory. Instead all elements occupy the<EM>
same</EM> memory and are located at offset 0 in the structure.
Naturally, suich a defnition basically does nothing more than to
assign the value of zero to a couple of symbols. It may however be
useful to clarify the overlap in a program and therefore to make it
more 'readable'. The size of a union is the maximum of all elements'
lengths.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_5_5_">3.5.5. Structures and Sections</A></H3>
<P>
Symbols that are created in the course of defining or usage of
structures are treated just like normal symbols, i.e. when used
within a section, these symbols are local to the section. The same is
however also true for the structures themselves, i.e. a structure
defined within a section cannot be used outside of the section.

<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
The assembler supports conditional assembly with the help of
statements like<TT> IF...</TT> resp.<TT> SWITCH...</TT> . These
statements work at assembly time allowing or disallowing the assembly
of program parts based on conditions. They are therefore not to be
compared with IF statements of high-level languages (though it would
be tempting to extend assembly language with structurization
statements of higher level languages...).

<P>
<TT> IF</TT> is the most common and most versatile construct. The
general style of an<TT> IF</TT> statement is as follows:
<PRE>

        IF      &lt;expression 1&gt;
        .
        .
        &lt;block 1&gt;
        .
        .
        ELSEIF  &lt;expression 2&gt;

        .
        &lt;block 2&gt;

        .
        .
        ELSEIF
        .
        .
        &lt;block n&gt;
        .
        .
        ENDIF

</PRE>
<TT>IF</TT> serves as an entry, evaluates the first expression, and
assembles block 1 if the expression is true (i.e. not 0). All
further<TT> ELSEIF</TT>-blocks will then be skipped. However, if the
expression is false, block 1 will be skipped and expression 2 is
evaluated. If this expression turns out to be true, block 2 is
assembled. The number of<TT> ELSEIF</TT> parts is variable and
results in an<TT> IF-THEN-ELSE</TT> ladder of an arbitrary length.
The block assigned to the last<TT> ELSEIF</TT> (without argument)
only gets assembled if all previous expressions evaluated to false;
it therefore forms a 'default' branch. It is important to note that
only<B> one</B> of the blocks will be assembled: the first one
whose<TT> IF/ELSEIF</TT> had a true expression as argument.
<P>
The<TT> ELSEIF</TT> parts are optional, i.e.<TT> IF</TT> may directly
be followed by an<TT> ENDIF</TT>. An<TT> ELSEIF</TT> without
parameters must be the last branch.
<P>
<TT> ELSEIF</TT> always refers to the innermost, unfinished<TT>

For everyIF... statement, there has to be a corresponding<TT>

<TT> CASE</TT> is a special case of<TT> IF</TT> and is designed for
situations when an expression has to be compared with a couple of
values. This could of course also be done with a series of<TT>
ELSEIF</TT>s, but the following form
<PRE>

        SWITCH  &lt;expression&gt;
        .
        .
        CASE    &lt;value 1&gt;

        &lt;block 1&gt;

        CASE    &lt;value n-1&gt;
        .
        &lt;block n-1&gt;

        ELSECASE
        .
        &lt;block n&gt;
        .
        ENDCASE

</PRE>
has the advantage that the expression is only written once and also
only gets evaluated once. It is therefore less error-prone and
slightly faster than an<TT> IF</TT> chain, but obviously not as
flexible.
<P>
It is possible to specify multiple values separated by commas to
a<TT> CASE</TT> statement in order to assemble the following block in
multiple cases. The<TT> ELSECASE</TT> branch again serves as a 'trap'
for the case that none of the<TT> CASE</TT> conditions was met. AS
will issue a warning in case it is missing and all comparisons fail.
<P>
Even when value lists of<TT> CASE</TT> branches overlap, only<B>
one</B> branch is executed, which is the first one in case of
ambiguities.
<P>
<TT> SWITCH</TT> only serves to open the whole construct; an
arbitrary number of statements may be between<TT> SWITCH</TT> and the
first<TT> CASE</TT> (but don't leave other<TT> IF</TT>s open!), for
the sake of better readability this should however not be done.
<P>
Similarly to<TT> IF</TT> constructs, there must be exactly one<TT>
ENDCASE</TT> for every<TT> SWITCH</TT>. Analogous to<TT> ENDIF</TT>,
for<TT> ENDCASE</TT> the line number of the corresponding<TT>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_7_1_">3.7.1. PAGE</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_PAGE_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> PAGE</TT> is used to tell AS the dimensions of the paper that is
used to print the assembly listing. The first parameter is thereby
the number of lines after which AS shall automatically output a form
feed. One should however take into account that this value does<B>
not</B> include heading lines including an eventual line specified
with<TT> TITLE</TT>. The minimum number of lines is 5, and the
maximum value is 255. A specification of 0 has the result that AS
will not do any form feeds except those triggered by a<TT>
NEWPAGE</TT> instruction or those implicitly engaged at the end of
the assembly listing (e.g. prior to the symbol table).
<P>
The specification of the listing's length in characters is an
optional second parameter and serves two purposes: on the one hand,
the internal line counter of AS will continue to run correctly when a
source line has to be split into several listing lines, and on the
other hand there are printers (like some laser printers) that do not
automatically wrap into a new line at line end but instead simply
discard the rest. For this reason, AS does line breaks by itself,
i.e. lines that are too long are split into chunks whose lengths are
equal to or smaller than the specified width. This may lead to double
line feeds on printers that can do line wraps on their own if one
specifies the exact line width as listing width. The solution for
such a case is to reduce the assembly listing's width by 1. The
specified line width may lie between 5 and 255 characters; a line
width of 0 means similarly to the page length that AS shall not do
any splitting of listing lines; lines that are too long of course
cannot be taken into account of the form feed then any more.
<P>
The default setting for the page length is 60 lines, the default for
the line width is 0; the latter value is also assumed when<TT>
PAGE</TT> is called with only one parameter.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> There is no way for AS to check whether the
specified listing length and width correspond to the reality!
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_7_2_">3.7.2. NEWPAGE</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_NEWPAGE_1"></A>
<P>
<TT> NEWPAGE</TT> can be used to force a line feed though the current
line is not full up to now. This might be useful to separate program
parts in the listing that are logically different. The internal line
counter is reset and the page counter is incremented by one. The
optional parameter is in conjunction with a hierarchical page
numbering AS supports up to a chapter depth of 4. 0 always refers to
the lowest depth, and the maximum value may vary during the assembly
run. This may look a bit puzzling, as the following example shows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE SUMMARY="No Summary" CELLPADDING=2>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> page 1,</TD><TD NOWRAP> instruction<TT> NEWPAGE 0</TT></TD><TD NOWRAP> -> page 2</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> page 2,</TD><TD NOWRAP> instruction<TT> NEWPAGE 1</TT></TD><TD NOWRAP> -> page 2.1</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> page 2.1,</TD><TD NOWRAP> instruction<TT> NEWPAGE 1</TT></TD><TD NOWRAP> -> page 3.1</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> page 3.1,</TD><TD NOWRAP> instruction<TT> NEWPAGE 0</TT></TD><TD NOWRAP> -> page 3.2</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP> page 3.2,</TD><TD NOWRAP> instruction<TT> NEWPAGE 2</TT></TD><TD NOWRAP> -> page 4.1.1</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP></TD></TR>
</TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT> NEWPAGE &lt;number&gt;</TT> may therefore result in changes in
different digits, depending on the current chapter depth. An
automatic form feed due to a line counter overflow or a<TT>
NEWPAGE</TT> without parameter is equal to<TT> NEWPAGE 0</TT>.
Previous to the output of the symbol table, an implicit<TT> NEWPAGE
&lt;maximum up to now&gt;</TT> is done to start a new 'main chapter'.

One can achieve by the statement

This is also the default.
<P>
There is a subtle difference between the meaning of<TT> MACEXP</TT>
for macros and for all other macro-like constructs (e.g.<TT>
REPT</TT>): while a macro contain an internal flag that rules whether
expansions of this macro shall be listed or not,<TT> MACEXP</TT>
directly influences all other constructs that are resolved 'in
place'. The reason for this differentiation is that there may be
macros that are tested and their expansion is therefore unnecessary,
but all other macros still shall be expanded.<TT> MACEXP</TT> serves
as a default for the macro's internal flag when it is defined, and it
may be overridden by the<TT> NOEXPAND</TT> resp.<TT> EXPAND</TT>

nothing at all will be written to the listing. This directive makes
sense for tested code parts or include files to avoid a paper

to issue the counterpart somewhere later, even the symbol table will
not be written any more! In addition to<TT> ON</TT> and<TT>
OFF</TT>,<TT> LISTING</TT> also accepts<TT> NOSKIPPED</TT> and<TT>
PURECODE</TT> as arguments. Program parts that were not assembled due

<P>
Quite often it makes sense to switch to another printing mode (like
compressed printing) when the listing is sent to a printer and to
deactivate this mode again at the end of the listing. The output of
the needed control sequences can be automated with these instructions
if one specifies the sequence that shall be sent to the output device
prior to the listing with<TT> PRTINIT &lt;string&gt;</TT> and
similarly the deinitialization string with<TT> PRTEXIT
&lt;string&gt;</TT>.<TT> &lt;string&gt;</TT> has to be a string
expression in both cases. The syntax rules for string constants allow
to insert control characters into the string without too much
tweaking.
<P>
When writing the listing, the assembler does<B> not</B> differentiate
where the listing actually goes, i.e. printer control characters are
sent to the screen without mercy!
<P>
Example:
<P>
For Epson printers, it makes sense to switch them to compressed
printing because listings are so wide. The lines
<PRE>

        prtinit "\15"
        prtexit "\18"

</PRE>
assure that the compressed mode is turned on at the beginning of the
listing and turned off afterwards.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_7_6_">3.7.6. TITLE</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_TITLE_1"></A>
<P>
The assembler normally adds a header line to each page of the listing
that contains the source file's name, date, and time. This statement
allows to extend the page header by an arbitrary additional line. The
string that has to be specified is an arbitrary string expression.
<P>
Example:
<P>
For the Epson printer already mentioned above, a title line shall be
written in wide mode, which makes it necessary to turn off the
compressed mode before:

local symbols and the section concept introduced with them are a
completely new function that was introduced with version 1.39. One
could say that this part is version ''1.0'' and therefore probably
not the optimum. Ideas and (constructive) criticism are therefore
especially wanted. I admittedly described the usage of sections how I
imagined it. It is therefore possible that the reality is not
entirely equal to the model in my head. I promise that in case of
discrepancies, changes will occur that the reality gets adapted to
the documentation and not vice versa (I was told that the latter
sometimes takes place in larger companies...).
<P>
AS does not generate linkable code (and this will probably not change
in the near future<TT> :-(</TT>). This fact forces one to always
assemble a program in a whole. In contrast to this technique, a
separation into linkable modules would have several advantages:
<UL>
<LI> shorter assembly times as only the modified modules have to be
    reassembled;</LI>
<LI> the option to set up defined interfaces among modules by definition
    of private and public symbols;</LI>
<LI> the smaller length of the individual modules reduces the number of
    symbols per module and therefore allows to use shorter symbol
    names that are still unique.</LI>
</UL>
Especially the last item was something that always nagged me: once
there was a label's name defined at the beginning of a 2000-lines
program, there was no way to reuse it somehow - even not at the
file's other end where routines with a completely different context
were placed. I was forced to use concatenated names in the style of
<PRE>

   &lt;subprogram name&gt;_&lt;symbol name&gt;

that had lengths ranging from 15 to 25 characters and made the
program difficult to overlook. The concept of section described in
detail in the following text was designed to cure at least the second
and third item of the list above. It is completely optional: if you
do not want to use sections, simply forget them and continue to work
like you did with previous versions of AS.

The name of a section must conform to the conventions for s symbol
name; AS stores section and symbol names in separate tables which is
the reason why a name may be used for a symbol and a section at the
same time. Section names must be unique in a sense that there must
not be more than one section on the same level with the same name (I
will explain in the next part what ''levels'' mean). The argument
of<TT> ENDSECTION</TT> is optional, it may also be omitted; if it is
omitted, AS will show the section's name that has been closed with
this<TT> ENDSECTION</TT>. Code inside a section will be processed by
AS exactly as if it were outside, except for three decisive
differences:
<UL>
<LI> Symbols defined within a section additionally get an internally
    generated number that corresponds to the section. These symbols
    are not accessible by code outside the section (this can be
    changed by pseudo instructions, later more about this).</LI>
<LI> The additional attribute allows to define symbols of the same name
    inside and outside the section; the attribute makes it possible
    to use a symbol name multiple times without getting error
    messages from AS.</LI>
<LI> If a symbol of a certain name has been defined inside and outside of
    a section, the ''local'' one will be preferred inside the
    section, i.e. AS first searches the symbol table for a symbol of
    the referenced name that also was assigned to the section. A
    search for a global symbol of this name only takes place if the
    first search fails.</LI>
</UL>
This mechanism e.g. allows to split the code into modules as one
might have done it with linkable code. A more fine-grained approach
would be to pack every routine into a separate section. Depending on
the individual routines' lengths, the symbols for internal use may
obtain very short names.
<P>
AS will by default not differentiate between upper and lower case in
section names; if one however switches to case-sensitive mode, the
case will be regarded just like for symbols.
<P>
The organization described up to now roughly corresponds to what is
possible in the C language that places all functions on the same
level. However, as my ''high-level'' ideal was Pascal and not C, I
went one step further:
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_8_2_">3.8.2. Nesting and Scope Rules</A></H3>
<P>
It is valid to define further sections within a section. This is
analog to the option given in Pascal to define procedures inside a
procedure or function. The following example shows this:
<PRE>

sym     EQU        0

        SECTION    ModuleA

         SECTION    ProcA1

sym       EQU        5

         ENDSECTION ProcA1

         SECTION    ProcA2

sym       EQU        10

         ENDSECTION ProcA2

        ENDSECTION ModuleA


        SECTION    ModuleB

sym      EQU        15

         SECTION    ProcB

         ENDSECTION ProcB

        ENDSECTION ModuleB

</PRE>
When looking up a symbol, AS first searches for a symbol assigned to
the current section, and afterwards traverses the list of parent
sections until the global symbols are reached. In our example, the
individual sections see the values given in table <A
HREF="#ref_TabSymErg">3.5</A> for the symbol<TT> sym</TT>:

This rule can be overridden by explicitly appending a section's name
to the symbol's name. The section's name has to be enclosed in
brackets:
<PRE>

        move.l  #sym[ModulB],d0

</PRE>
Only sections that are in the parent section path of the current
section may be used. The special values<TT> PARENT0..PARENT9</TT> are
allowed to reference the n-th ''parent'' of the current section;<TT>
PARENT0</TT> is therefore equivalent to the current section
itself,<TT> PARENT1</TT> the direct parent and so on.<TT>
PARENT1</TT> may be abbreviated as<TT> PARENT</TT>. If no name is
given between the brackets, like in this example:
<PRE>

        move.l  #sym[],d0 ,

</PRE>
one reaches the global symbol.<B> CAUTION!</B> If one explicitly
references a symbol from a certain section, AS will only seek for
symbols from this section, i.e. the traversal of the parent sections
path is omitted!
<P>
Similar to Pascal, it is allowed that different sections have
subsections of the same name; the principle of locality avoids
irritations. One should IMHO still use this feature as seldom as
possible: Symbols listed in the symbol resp. cross reference list are
only marked with the section they are assigned to, not with the
''section hierarchy'' lying above them (this really would have busted
the available space); a differentiation is made very difficult this
way.
<P>
As a<TT> SECTION</TT> instruction does not define a label by itself,
the section concept has an important difference to Pascal's concept
of nested procedures: a pascal procedure can automatically ''see''
its subprocedures(functions), AS requires an explicit definition of
an entry point. This can be done e.g. with the following macro pair:
<PRE>

proc    MACRO   name
        SECTION name
name    LABEL   $
        ENDM

endp    MACRO   name
        ENDSECTION name
        ENDM

</PRE>
This example also shows that the locality of labels inside macros is
not influenced by sections. It makes the trick with the<TT>
LABEL</TT> instruction necessary.
<P>
This does of course not solve the problem completely. The label is
still local and not referencable from the outside. Those who think
that it would suffice to place the label in front of the<TT>
SECTION</TT> statement should be quiet because they would spoil the
bridge to the next theme:
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_8_3_">3.8.3. PUBLIC and GLOBAL</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_PUBLIC_1"></A><A NAME="index_GLOBAL_1"></A>
<P>
The<TT> PUBLIC</TT> statement allows to change the assignment of a
symbol to a certain section. It is possible to treat multiple symbols
with one statement, but I will use an example with only one symbol in
the following (not hurting the generality of this discussion). In the
simplest case, one declares a symbol to be global, i.e. it can be
referenced from anywhere in the program:
<PRE>

        PUBLIC  &lt;name&gt;

</PRE>
As a symbol cannot be moved in the symbol table once it has been
sorted in, this statement has to appear<B> before</B> the symbol
itself is defined. AS stores all<TT> PUBLICs</TT> in a list and
removes an entry from this list when the corresponding symbol is
defined. AS prints errors at the end of a section in case that not
all<TT> PUBLICs</TT> have been resolved.
<P>
Regarding the hierarchical section concept, the method of defining a
symbol as purely global looks extremely brute. There is fortunately a
way to do this in a bit more differentiated way: by appending a
section name:
<PRE>

        PUBLIC  &lt;name&gt;:&lt;section&gt;

</PRE>
The symbol will be assigned to the referenced section and therefore
also becomes accessible for all its subsections (except they define a
symbol of the same name that hides the ''more global'' symbol). AS
will naturally protest if several subsections try to export a symbol
of same name to the same level. The special<TT> PARENTn</TT> values
mentioned in the previous section are also valid for<TT>
&lt;section&gt;</TT> to export a symbol exactly<TT> n</TT> levels up
in the section hierarchy. Otherwise only sections that are parent
sections of the current section are valid for<TT>
&lt;section&gt;</TT>. Sections that are in another part of the
section tree are not allowed. If several sections in the parent
section path should have the same name (this is possible), the lowest
level will be taken.
<P>
This tool lets the abovementioned macro become useful:
<PRE>

proc    MACRO   name
        SECTION name
        PUBLIC  name:PARENT
name    LABEL   $
        ENDM

</PRE>
This setting is equal to the Pascal model that also only allows the
''father'' to see its children, but not the ''grandpa''.
<P>
AS will quarrel about double-defined symbols if more than one section
attempts to export a symbol of a certain name to the same upper
section. This is by itself a correct reaction, and one needs to
''qualify'' symbols somehow to make them distinguishable if these
exports were deliberate. A<TT> GLOBAL</TT> statement does just this.
The syntax of<TT> GLOBAL</TT> is identical to<TT> PUBLIC</TT>, but
the symbol stays local instead of being assigned to a higher section.
Instead, an additional symbol of the same value but with the
subsection's name appended to the symbol's name is created, and only
this symbol is made public according to the section specification. If
for example two sections<TT> A</TT> and<TT> B</TT> both define a
symbol named<TT> SYM</TT> and export it with a<TT> GLOBAL</TT>
statement to their parent section, the symbols are sorted in under
the names<TT> A_SYM</TT> resp.<TT> B_SYM</TT> .
<P>
In case that source and target section are separated by more than one
level, the complete name path is prepended to the symbol name.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_8_4_">3.8.4. FORWARD</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_FORWARD_1"></A>
<P>
The model described so far may look beautiful, but there is an
additional detail not present in Pascal that may spoil the happiness:
Assembler allows forward references. Forward references may lead to
situations where AS accesses a symbol from a higher section in the
first pass. This is not a disaster by itself as long as the correct
symbol is used in the second pass, but accidents of the following
type may happen:
<PRE>

loop:   .
        &lt;code&gt;
        .
        .
        SECTION sub
        .               ; ***
        .
        bra.s   loop
        .
        .
loop:   .
        .
        ENDSECTION
        .
        .
        jmp     loop    ; main loop

</PRE>
AS will take the global label<TT> loop</TT> in the first pass and
will quarrel about an out-of-branch situation if the program part
at<TT> &lt;code&gt;</TT> is long enough. The second pass will not be
started at all. One way to avoid the ambiguity would be to explicitly
specify the symbol's section:
<PRE>

        bra.s   loop[sub]

</PRE>
If a local symbol is referenced several times, the brackets can be
saved by using a<TT> FORWARD</TT> statement. The symbol is thereby
explicitly announced to be local, and AS will only look in the local
symbol table part when this symbol is referenced. For our example,
the statement
<PRE>

        FORWARD loop

</PRE>
should be placed at the position marked with<TT> ***</TT>.
<P>
<TT> FORWARD</TT> must not only be stated prior to a symbol's
definition, but also prior to its first usage in a section to make
sense. It does not make sense to define a symbol private and public;
this will be regarded as an error by AS.

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_8_5_">3.8.5. Performance Aspects</A></H3>

The multi-stage lookup in the symbol table and the decision to which
section a symbol shall be assigned of course cost a bit of time to
compute. An 8086 program of 1800 lines length for example took 34.5
instead of 33 seconds after a modification to use sections (80386 SX,
16MHz, 3 passes). The overhead is therefore limited. As it has
already been stated at the beginning, is is up to the programmer if
(s)he wants to accept it. One can still use AS without sections.

This statement instructs AS to write the symbols given in the

upon the command line parameters described in section <A

generated at all and in which format it is written. If AS detects
this instruction and no share file is generated, a warning is the

will be copied to the first line outputted to the share file (if<TT>

Via the<TT> -i &lt;path list&gt;</TT> option, one can specify a list

Though the assembler checks source files as strict as possible and
delivers differentiated error messages, it might be necessary from
time to time to issue additional error messages that allow an
automatic check for logical error. The assembler distinguishes among
three different types of error messages that are accessible to the
programmer via the following three instructions:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>WARNING</TT>: Errors that hint at possibly wrong or inefficient
    code. Assembly continues and a code file is generated.</LI>
<LI> <TT>ERROR</TT>: True errors in a program. Assembly continues to
    allow detection of possible further errors in the same pass. A
    code file is not generated.</LI>
<LI> <TT>FATAL</TT>: Serious errors that force an immediate termination
    of assembly. A code file may be generated but will be
    incomplete.</LI>
</UL>
All three instructions have the same format for the message that
shall be issued: an arbitrary (possibly computed?!) string expression
which may therefore be either a constant or variable.
<P>
These instructions generally only make sense in conjunction wit
conditional assembly. For example, if there is only a limited address
space for a program, one can test for overflow in the following way:
<PRE>

ROMSize equ     8000h   ; 27256 EPROM

ProgStart: 
        .
        .
        &lt;the program itself&gt;
        .
        .
ProgEnd:   

        if      ProgEnd-ProgStart&gt;ROMSize
         error  "\athe program is too long!"
        endif

</PRE>
Apart from the instructions generating errors, there is also an
instruction<TT> MESSAGE</TT> that simply prints a message to the
console resp. to the assembly listing. Its usage is equal to the
other three instructions.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_3_9_5_">3.9.5. READ</A></H3>
<A NAME="index_READ_1"></A><EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
One could say that<TT> READ</TT> is the counterpart to the previous
instruction group: it allows to read values from the keyboard during
assembly. You might ask what this is good for. I will break with the
previous principles and put an example before the exact description
to outline the usefulness of this instruction:
<P>
A program needs for data transfers a buffer of a size that should be
set at assembly time. One could store this size in a symbol defined
with<TT> EQU</TT>, but it can also be done interactively with<TT>
READ</TT>:
<PRE>

        IF      MomPass=1
         READ    "buffer size",BufferSize
        ENDIF

</PRE>
Programs can this way configure themselves dynamically during
assembly and one could hand over the source to someone who can
assemble it without having to dive into the source code. The<TT>
IF</TT> conditional shown in the example should always be used to
avoid bothering the user multiple times with questions.
<P>
<TT> READ</TT> is quite similar to<TT> SET</TT> with the difference
that the value is read from the keyboard instead of the instruction's
arguments. This for example also implies that AS will automatically
set the symbol's type (integer, float or string) or that it is valid
to enter formula expressions instead of a simple constant.
<P>
<TT> READ</TT> may either have one or two parameters because the
prompting message is optional. AS will print a message constructed
from the symbol's name if it is omitted.

<A NAME="ref_SectRELAXED"></A><A NAME="index_RELAXED_1"></A>
<P>
<EM> valid for: all processors</EM>
<P>
By default, AS assigns a distinct syntax for integer constants to a
processor family (which is in general equal to the manufacturer's
specifications, as long as the syntax is not too bizarre...).
Everyone however has his own preferences for another syntax and may
well live with the fact that his programs cannot be translated any
more with the standard assembler. If one places the instruction
<PRE>

        RELAXED ON

</PRE>
right at the program's beginning, one may furtherly use any syntax
for integer constants, even mixed in a program. AS tries to guess
automatically for every expression the syntax that was used. This
automatism does not always deliver the result one might have in mind,
and this is also the reason why this option has to be enable
explicitly: if there are no prefixes or postfixes that unambiguously
identify either Intel or Motorola syntax, the C mode will be used.
Leading zeroes that are superfluous in other modes have a meaning in
this mode:
<PRE>

        move.b  #08,d0

</PRE>
This constant will be understood as an octal constant and will result
in an error message as octal numbers may only contain digits from 0
to 7. One might call this a lucky case; a number like 077 would
result in trouble without getting a message about this. Without the
relaxed mode, both expressions unambiguously would have been
identified as decimal constants.

''Where can I buy such a beast, a HC11 in NMOS?'', some of you might

have accepted such a name because of this), and so I decided to omit
all the letters...

From time to time, one is forced to revise one's opinions. Some

However, it seems that it can do more than I wanted to
believe...after the n+1th request, I sat down once again to work on
it and things seem to work now. You may use either spaces or commas,
but not in all variants, to avoid ambiguities: for every variant of
an instruction, it is possible to use only commas or a mixture of
spaces and commas as Motorola seems to have defined it (their data
books do not always have the quality of the corresponding
hardware...):

With the K4 version of the HC11, Motorola has introduced a banking
scheme, which one one hand easily allows to once again extend an
architecture that has become 'too small', but on the other hand not
really makes programmers' and tool developers' lifes simpler...how
does one sensibly map something like this on a model for a
programmer?
<P>
The K4 architecture<EM> extends</EM> the HC11 address space by 2x512
Kbytes, which means that we now have a total address space of
64+1024=1088 Kbytes. AS acts like this were one large unified addres
space, with the following layout:
<UL>
<LI> $000000...$00ffff: the old HC11 address space</LI>
<LI> $010000...$08ffff: Window 1</LI>
<LI> $090000...$10ffff: Window 2</LI>
</UL>
Via the<TT> ASSUME</TT> statement, one tells AS how the banking
registers are set up, which in turn describes which extended areas
are mapped to which physical addresses. For absolute addresses modes
with addresses beyond $10000, AS automatically computes the address
within the first 64K that is to be used. Of course this only works
for direct addressing modes, it is the programmer's responsibility to
keep the overview for indirect or indexed addressing modes!
<P>
In case one is not really sure if the current mapping is really the
desired one, the pseudo instruction<TT> PRWINS</TT> may be used,
which prints the assumes MMxxx register contents plus the current
mapping(s), like this:
<PRE>

MMSIZ $e1 MMWBR $84 MM1CR $00 MM2CR $80
Window 1: 10000...12000 --&gt; 4000...6000
Window 1: 90000...94000 --&gt; 8000...c000

</PRE>
An instruction
<PRE>

        jmp     *+3

</PRE>
located at $10000 would effectively result in a jump to address
$4003.

Of course, it is a bit crazy idea to add support in AS for a
processor that was mostly designed for usage in work stations.
Remember that AS mainly is targeted at programmers of single board
computers. But things that today represent the absolute high end in
computing will be average tomorrow and maybe obsolete the next day,
and in the meantime, the Z80 as the 8088 have been retired as CPUs
for personal computers and been moved to the embedded market;
modified versions are marketed as microcontrollers. With the
appearance of the MPC505 and PPC403, my suspicion has proven to be
true that IBM and Motorola try to promote this architecture in as
many fields as possible.
<P>
However, the current support is a bit incomplete: Temporarily, the
Intel-style mnemonics are used to allow storage of data and the more
uncommon RS/6000 machine instructions mentioned in <A
HREF="#cite_Mot601">[57]</A> are missing (hopefully noone misses
them!). I will finish this as soon as information about them is
available!

Motorola, which devil rode you! Which person in your company had the
''brilliant'' idea to separate the parallel data transfers with
spaces! In result, everyone who wants to make his code a bit more
readable, e.g. like this:
<PRE>

        move    x:var9 ,r0
        move    y:var10,r3   ,

</PRE>
is p****ed because the space gets recognized as a separator for
parallel data transfers!
<P>
Well...Motorola defined it that way, and I cannot change it. Using
tabs instead of spaces to separate the parallel operations is also
allowed, and the individual operations' parts are again separated
with commas, as one would expect it.
<P>
<A HREF="#cite_Mot56">[52]</A> states that instead of using<TT>
MOVEC, MOVEM, ANDI</TT> or<TT> ORI</TT>, it is also valid to use the
more general Mnemonics<TT> MODE, AND</TT> or<TT> OR</TT>. AS
(currently) does not support this.

Regarding the assembler syntax of these processors, Hitachi
generously copied from Motorola (that wasn't by far the worst
choice...), unfortunately the company wanted to introduce its own
format for hexadecimal numbers. To make it even worse, it is a format
that uses unbalanced single quotes, just like Microchip does. This is
something I could not (I even did not want to) reproduce with AS, as
AS uses single quotes to surround ASCII character sequences. Instead,
one has to write hexadecimal numbers in the well-known Motorola
syntax: with a leading dollar sign.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_5_">4.5. SH7000/7600/7700</A></H2>

Unfortunately, Hitachi once again used their own format for
hexadecimal numbers, and once again I was not able to reproduce this
with AS...please use Motorola syntax!
<P>
When using literals and the<TT> LTORG</TT> instruction, a few things
have to be kept in mind if you do not want to suddenly get confronted
with strange error messages:
<P>
Literals exist due to the fact that the processor is unable to load
constants out of a range of -128 to 127 with immediate addressing. AS
(and the Hitachi assembler) hide this inability by the automatic
placement of constants in memory which are then referenced via
PC-relative addressing. The question that now arises is where to
locate these constants in memory. AS does not automatically place a
constant in memory when it is needed; instead, they are collected
until an LTORG instruction occurs. The collected constants are then
dumped en bloc, and their addresses are stored in ordinary labels
which are also visible in the symbol table. Such a label's name is of
the form
<PRE>

    LITERAL_s_xxxx_n  .

</PRE>
In this name,<TT> s</TT> represents the literal's type. Possible
values are<TT> W</TT> for 16-bit constants,<TT> L</TT> for 32-bit
constants and<TT> F</TT> for forward references where AS cannot
decide in anticipation which size is needed. In case of<TT> s=W</TT>
or<TT> L</TT>,<TT> xxxx</TT> denotes the constant's value in a
hexadecimal notation, whereas<TT> xxxx</TT> is a simple running
number for forward references (in a forward reference, one does not
know the value of a constant when it is referenced, so one obviously
cannot incorporate its value into the name).<TT> n</TT> is a counter
that signifies how often a literal of this value previously occurred
in the current section. Literals follow the standard rules for
localization by sections. It is therefore absolutely necessary to
place literals that were generated in a certain section before the
section is terminated!
<P>
The numbering with<TT> n</TT> is necessary because a literal may
occur multiple times in a section. One reason for this situation is
that PC-relative addressing only allows positive offsets; Literals
that have once been placed with an<TT> LTORG</TT> can therefore not
be referenced in the code that follows. The other reason is that the
displacement is generally limited in length (512 resp. 1024 bytes).
<P>
An automatic<TT> LTORG</TT> at the end of a program or previously to
switching to a different target CPU does not occur; if AS detects
unplaced literals in such a situation, an error message is printed.
<P>
As the PC-relative addressing mode uses the address of the current
instruction plus 4, it is not possible to access a literal that is
stored directly after the instruction, like in the following example:
<PRE>

        mov     #$1234,r6
        ltorg

</PRE>
This is a minor item since the CPU anyway would try to execute the
following data as code. Such a situation should not occur in a real
program...another pitfall is far more real: if PC-relative addressing
occurs just behind a delayed branch, the program counter is already
set to the destination address, and the displacement is computed
relative to the branch target plus 2. Following is an example where
this detail leads to a literal that cannot be addressed:
<PRE>

        bra     Target
        mov     #$12345678,r4        ; is executed
        .
        .
        ltorg                        ; here is the literal
        .
        .
Target: mov     r4,r7                ; execution continues here

</PRE>
As<TT> Target</TT>+2 is on an address behind the literal, a negative
displacement would result. Things become especially hairy when one of
the branch instructions<TT> JMP, JSR, BRAF, or BSRF</TT> is used: as
AS cannot calculate the target address (it is generated at runtime
from a register's contents), a PC value is assumed that should never
fit, effectively disabling any PC-relative addressing at this point.
<P>
It is not possible to deduce the memory usage from the count and size
of literals. AS might need to insert a padding word to align a long
word to an address that is evenly divisible by 4; on the other hand,
AS might reuse parts of a 32-bit literal for other 16-bit literals.
Of course multiple use of a literal with a certain value will create
only one entry. However, such optimizations are completely suppressed
for forward references as AS does not know anything about their
value.
<P>
As literals use the PC-relative addressing which is only allowed for
the<TT> MOV</TT> instruction, the usage of literals is also limited
to<TT> MOV</TT> instructions. The way AS uses the operand size is a
bit tricky: A specification of a byte or word move means to generate
the shortest possible instruction that results in the desired value
placed in the register's lowest 8 resp. 16 bits. The upper 24 resp.
16 bits are treated as ''don't care''. However, if one specifies a
longword move or omits the size specification completely, this means
that the complete 32-bit register should contain the desired value.
For example, in the following sequence
<PRE>

        mov.b   #$c0,r0
        mov.w   #$c0,r0
        mov.l   #$c0,r0   ,

</PRE>
the first instruction will result in true immediate addressing, the
second and third instruction will use a word literal: As bit 7 in the
number is set, the byte instruction will effectively create the value
$FFFFFFC0 in the register. According to the convention, this wouldn't
be the desired value in the second and third example. However, a word
literal is also sufficient for the third case because the processor
will copy a cleared bit 15 of the operand to bits 16..31.
<P>
As one can see, the whole literal stuff is rather complex; I'm sorry
but there was no chance of making things simpler. It is unfortunately
a part of its nature that one sometimes gets error messages about
literals that were not found, which logically should not occur
because AS does the literal processing completely on his own.
However, if other errors occur in the second pass, all following
labels will move because AS does not generate any code any more for
statements that have been identified as erroneous. As literal names
are partially built from other symbols' values, other errors might
follow because literal names searched in the second pass differ from
the names stored in the first pass and AS quarrels about undefined
symbols...if such errors should occur, please correct all other
errors first before you start cursing on me and literals...
<P>
People who come out of the Motorola scene and want to use PC-relative
addressing explicitly (e.g. to address variables in a
position-independent way) should know that if this addressing mode is
written like in the programmer's manual:
<PRE>

        mov.l   @(Var,PC),r8

</PRE>
<B>no</B> implicit conversion of the address to a displacement will
occur, i.e. the operand is inserted as-is into the machine code (this
will probably generate a value range error...). If you want to use
PC-relative addressing on the SH7x00, simply use ''absolute''
addressing (which does not exist on machine level):
<PRE>

        mov.l   Var,r8

</PRE>
In this example, the displacement will be calculated correctly (of
course, the same limitations apply for the displacement as it was the
case for literals).
<P>

The program memory of these microcontrollers is organized in pages of
128 words. Honestly said, this organization only exists because there
are on the one hand branch instructions with a target that must lie
within the same page, and on the other hand ''long'' branches that
can reach the whole address space. The standard syntax defined by
Mitsubishi demands that page number and offset have to be written as
two distinct arguments for the latter instructions. As this is quite
inconvenient (except for indirect jumps, a programmer has no other
reason to deal with pages), AS also allows to write the target
address in a ''linear'' style, for example
<PRE>

        bl      $1234

</PRE>
instead of
<PRE>

        bl      $24,$34 .

you are using them on your own risk. There is no guarantee that all

the CMOS successors of the 6502, since they allocated the

Microcontrollers of this family have a quite nice, however
well-hidden feature: If one sets bit 5 of the status register with
the<TT> SET</TT> instruction, the accumulator will be replaced with
the memory cell addressed by the X register for all load/store and
arithmetic instructions. An attempt to integrate this feature cleanly
into the assembly syntax has not been made so far, so the only way to
use it is currently the ''hard'' way (<TT>SET</TT>...instructions
with accumulator addressing...<TT>CLT</TT>).
<P>
Not all MELPS-740 processors implement all instructions. This is a
place where the programmer has to watch out for himself that no
instructions are used that are unavailable for the targeted
processor; AS does not differentiate among the individual processors
of this family. For a description of the details regarding special
page addressing, see the discussion of the<TT> ASSUME</TT>

As it seems, these two processor families took disjunct development
paths, starting from the 6502 via their 8 bit predecessors. Shortly
listed, the following differences are present:
<UL>
<LI> The 65816 does not have a B accumulator.</LI>
<LI> The 65816 does not have instructions to multiply or divide.</LI>
<LI> The 65816 misses the instructions<TT> SEB, CLB, BBC, BBS, CLM, SEM,
    PSH, PUL</TT> and<TT> LDM</TT>. Instead, the instructions<TT>
    TSB, TRB, BIT, CLD, SED, XBA, XCE</TT> and<TT> STZ</TT> take
    their places in the opcode table.</LI>
</UL>
The following instructions have identical function, yet different
names:

<P>
Especially tricky are the instructions<TT> PHB, PLB</TT> and<TT>
TSB</TT>: these instructions have a totally different encoding and
meaning on both processors!
<P>
Unfortunately, these processors address their memory in a way that is
IMHO even one level higher on the open-ended chart of perversity than
the Intel-like segmentation: They do banking! Well, this seems to be
the price for the 6502 upward-compatibility; before one can use AS to
write code for these processors, one has to inform AS about the
contents of several registers (using the<TT> ASSUME</TT>
instruction):
<P>
The M flag rules whether the accumulators A and B should be used with
8 bits (1) or 16 bits (0) width. Analogously, the X flag decides the
width of the X and Y index registers. AS needs this information for
the decision about the argument's width when immediate addressing
(#&lt;constant&gt;) occurs.
<P>
The memory is organized in 256 banks of 64 KBytes. As all registers
in the CPU core have a maximum width of 16 bits, the upper 8 bits
have to be fetched from 2 special bank registers: DT delivers the
upper 8 bits for data accesses, and PG extends the 16-bit program
counter to 24 bits. A 16 bits wide register DPR allows to move the
zero page known from the 6502 to an arbitrary location in the first
bank. If AS encounters an address (it is irrelevant if this address
is part of an absolute, indexed, or indirect expression), the
following addressing modes will be tested:
<OL>
<LI>Is the address in the range of DPR..DPR+$ff? If yes, use direct
    addressing with an 8-bit address.</LI>
<LI>Is the address contained in the page addressable via DT (resp. PG for
    branch instructions)? If yes, use absolute addressing with a
    16-bit address.</LI>
<LI>If nothing else helps, use long addressing with a 24-bit
    address.</LI>
</OL>
As one can see from this enumeration, the knowledge about the current
values of DT, PG and DPR is essential for a correct operation of AS;
if the specifications are incorrect, the program will probably do
wrong addressing at runtime. This enumeration also implied that all
three address lengths are available; if this is not the case, the
decision chain will become shorter.
<P>
The automatic determination of the address length described above may
be overridden by the usage of prefixes. If one prefixes the address
by a &lt;, &gt;, or &gt;&gt; without a separating space, an address
with 1, 2, or 3 bytes of length will be used, regardless if this is
the optimal length. If one uses an address length that is either not
allowed for the current instruction or too short for the address, an
error message is the result.
<P>
To simplify porting of 6502 programs, AS uses the Motorola syntax for
hexadecimal constants instead of the Intel/IEEE syntax that is the
format preferred by Mitsubishi for their 740xxx series. I still think
that this is the better format, and it looks as if the designers of
the 65816 were of the same opinion (as the<TT> RELAXED</TT>
instruction allows the alternative use of Intel notation, this
decision should not hurt anything). Another important detail for the
porting of programs is that it is valid to omit the accumulator A as
target for operations. For example, it is possible to simply write
LDA #0 instead of LDA A,#0.
<P>
A real goodie in the instruction set are the instructions<TT>
MVN</TT> resp.<TT> MVP</TT> to do block transfers. However, their
address specification rules are a bit strange: bits 0--15 are stored
in index registers, bits 16--23 are part of the instruction. When one
uses AS, one simply specifies the full destination and source
addresses. AS will then automatically grab the correct bits. This is
a fine yet important difference Mitsubishi's assembler where you have
to extract the upper 8 bits on your own. Things become really
convenient when a macro like the following is used:
<PRE>

mvpos   macro   src,dest,len
        if      MomCPU=$7700
         lda    #len
        elseif
         lda    #(len-1)
        endif
        ldx     #(src&$ffff)
        ldy     #(dest&$ffff)
        mvp     dest,src
        endm

</PRE>
Caution, possible pitfall: if the accumulator contains the value n,
the Mitsubishi chip will transfer n bytes, but the 65816 will
transfer n+1 bytes!
<P>
The<TT> PSH</TT> and<TT> PUL</TT> instructions are also very handy
because they allow to save a user-defined set to be saved to the
stack resp. to be restored from the stack. According to the
Mitsubishi data book <A HREF="#cite_Mit16">[41]</A>, the bit mask has
to be specified as an immediate operand, so the programmer either has
to keep all bit<->register assignments in mind or he has to define
some appropriate symbols. To make things simpler, I decided to extend
the syntax at this point: It is valid to use a list as argument which
may contain an arbitrary sequence of register names or immediate
expressions. Therefore, the following instructions
<PRE>

        psh     #$0f
        psh     a,b,#$0c
        psh     a,b,x,y 


</PRE>
are equivalent. As immediate expressions are still valid, AS stays
upward compatible to the Mitsubishi assemblers.
<P>
One thing I did not fully understand while studying the Mitsubishi
assembler is the treatment of the<TT> PER</TT> instruction: this
instruction allows to push a 16-bit variable onto the stack whose
address is specified relative to the program counter. Therefore, it
is an absolute addressing mode from the programmer's point of view.
Nevertheless, the Mitsubishi assembler requests immediate addressing,
and the instructions argument is placed into the code just as-is. One
has to calculate the address in his own, which is something symbolic
assemblers were designed for to avoid...as I wanted to stay
compatible, AS contains a compromise: If one chooses immediate
addressing (with a leading # sign), AS will behave like the original
from Mitsubishi. But if the # sign is omitted, as will calculate the
difference between the argument's value and the current program
counter and insert this difference instead.
<P>
A similar situation exists for the<TT> PEI</TT> instruction that
pushes the contents of a 16-bit variable located in the zero page:
Though the operand represents an address, once again immediate
addressing is required. In this case, AS will simply allow both
variants (i.e. with or without a # sign).
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_10_">4.10. M16</A></H2>
<P>
The M16 family is a family of highly complex CISC processors with an
equally complicated instruction set. One of the instruction set's
properties is the detail that in an instruction with two operands,
both operands may be of different sizes. The method of appending the
operand size as an attribute of the instruction (known from Motorola
and adopted from Mitsubishi) therefore had to be extended: it is
valid to append attributes to the operands themselves. For example,
the following instruction
<PRE>

        mov     r0.b,r6.w

</PRE>
reads the lowest 8 bits of register 0, sign-extends them to 32 bits
and stores the result into register 6. However, as one does not need
this feature in 9 out of 10 cases, it is still valid to append the
operand size to the instruction itself, e.g.
<PRE>

        mov.w   r0,r6

</PRE>
Both variants may be mixed; in such a case, an operand size appended
to an operand overrules the ''default''. An exception are
instructions with two operands. For these instructions, the default
for the source operand is the destination operand's size. For
example, in the following example
<PRE>

        mov.h   r0,r6.w

</PRE>
register 0 is accessed with 32 bits, the size specification appended
to the instruction is not used at all. If an instruction does not
contain any size specifications, word size (<TT>w</TT>) will be used.
Remember: in contrast to the 68000 family, this means 32 bits instead
of 16 bits!
<P>
The chained addressing modes are also rather complex; the ability of
AS to automatically assign address components to parts of the chain
keeps things at least halfway manageable. The only way of influencing
AS allows (the original assembler from Mitsubishi/Green Hills allows
a bit more in this respect) is the explicit setting of displacement
lengths by appending<TT> :4, :16</TT> and<TT> :32</TT>.

Thanks to John Weinrich, I now have the official Intel data sheets
describing these 'grandfathers' of all microprocessors, and the
questions about the syntax of register pairs (for 8-bit operations)
have been weeded out for the moment: It is<TT> RnRm</TT> with<TT>
n</TT> resp.<TT> m</TT> being even integers in the range from 0 to E
resp. 1 to F. The equation<TT> m = n + 1</TT> must be fulfilled.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_12_">4.12. MCS-48</A></H2>
<P>
The maximum address space of these processors is 4 Kbytes large. This
address space is not organized in a linear way (how could this be on
an Intel CPU...). Instead, it is split into 2 banks of 2 Kbytes. The
only way to change the program counter from one bank to the other are
the instructions<TT> CALL</TT> and<TT> JMP</TT>, by setting the most
significant bit of the address with the instructions<TT> SEL MB0</TT>
resp.<TT> SEL MB1</TT>.
<P>
To simplify jumps between these two banks, the instructions<TT>
JMP</TT> and<TT> CALL</TT> contain an automatism that inserts one of
these two instructions if the current program counter and the target
address are in different banks. Explicit usage of these<TT> SEL
MBx</TT> instructions should therefore not be necessary (though it is
possible), and it can puzzle the automatism, like in the following
example:
<PRE>

 000:  SEL      MB1
       JMP      200h

</PRE>
AS assumes that the MB flag is 0 and therefore does not insert a<TT>
SEL MBO</TT> instruction, with the result that the CPU jumps to
address A00h.
<P>
Furthermore, one should keep in mind that a jump instruction might
become longer (3 instead of 2 bytes).
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_13_">4.13. MCS-51</A></H2>
<P>
The assembler is accompanied by the files<TT> STDDEF51.INC</TT>
resp.<TT> 80C50X.INC</TT> that define all bits and SFRs of the
processors 8051, 8052, and 80515 resp. 80C501, 502, and 504.
Depending on the target processor setting (made with the<TT> CPU</TT>
statement), the correct subset will be included. Therefore, the
correct order for the instructions at the beginning of a program is
<PRE>

        CPU     &lt;processor type&gt;
        INCLUDE stddef51.inc   .

</PRE>
Otherwise, the MCS-51 pseudo instructions will lead to error
messages.
<P>
As the 8051 does not have instructions to to push the registers 0..7
onto the stack, one has to work with absolute addresses. However,
these addresses depend on which register bank is currently active. To
make this situation a little bit better, the include files define the
macro<TT> USING</TT> that accepts the symbols<TT> Bank0...Bank3</TT>
as arguments. In response, the macro will assign the registers'
correct absolute addresses to the symbols<TT> AR0..AR7</TT>. This
macro should be used after every change of the register banks. The
macro itself does<B> not</B> generate any code to switch to the bank!
<P>
The macro also makes bookkeeping about which banks have been used.
The result is stored in the integer variable<TT> RegUsage</TT>: bit 0
corresponds to bank 0, bit 1 corresponds to bank 1. and so on. To
output its contents after the source has been assembled, use
something like the following piece of code:
<PRE>

        irp       BANK,Bank0,Bank1,Bank2,Bank3
         if        (RegUsage&(2^BANK))&lt;&gt;0
          message   "bank \{BANK} has been used"
         endif
        endm

</PRE>
The multipass feature introduced with version 1.38 allowed to
introduce the additional instructions<TT> JMP</TT> and<TT> CALL</TT>.
If branches are coded using these instructions, AS will automatically
use the variant that is optimal for the given target address. The
options are<TT> SJMP, AJMP</TT>, or<TT> LJMP</TT> for<TT> JMP</TT>
resp.<TT> ACALL</TT> or<TT> LCALL</TT> for<TT> CALL</TT>. Of course
it is still possible to use these variants directly, in case one
wants to force a certain coding.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_14_">4.14. MCS-251</A></H2>
<P>
When designing the 80C251, Intel really tried to make the move to the
new family as smooth as possible for programmers. This culminated in
the fact that old applications can run on the new processor without
having to recompile them. However, as soon as one wants to use the
new features, some details have to be regarded which may turn into
hidden pitfalls.
<P>
The most important thing is the absence of a distinct address space
for bits on the 80C251. All SFRs can now be addressed bitwise,
regardless of their address. Furthermore, the first 128 bytes of the
internal RAM are also bit addressable. This has become possible
because bits are not any more handled by a separate address space
that overlaps other address spaces. Instead, similar to other
processors, bits are addressed with a two-dimensional address that
consists of the memory location containing the bit and the bit's
location in the byte. One result is that in an expression like<TT>
PSW.7</TT>, AS will do the separation of address and bit position
itself. Unlike to the 8051, it is not any more necessary to
explicitly generate 8 bit symbols. This has the other result that
the<TT> SFRB</TT> instruction does not exist any more. If it is used
in a program that shall be ported, it may be replaced with a
simple<TT> SFR</TT> instruction.
<P>
Furthermore, Intel cleaned up the cornucopia of different address
spaces on the 8051: the internal RAM (<TT>DATA</TT> resp.<TT>
IDATA</TT>), the<TT> XDATA</TT> space and the former<TT> CODE</TT>
space were unified to a single<TT> CODE</TT> space that is now 16
Mbytes large. The internal RAM starts at address 0, the internal ROM
starts at address ff0000h, which is the address code has to be
relocated to. In contrast, the SFRs were moved to a separate address
space (which AS refers to as the<TT> IO</TT> segment). However, they
have the same addresses in this new address space as they used to
have on the 8051. The<TT> SFR</TT> instructions knows of this
difference and automatically assigns symbols to either the<TT>
DATA</TT> or<TT> IO</TT> segment, depending on the target processor.
As there is no<TT> BIT</TT> segment any more, the<TT> BIT</TT>
instruction operates completely different: Instead of a linear
address ranging from 0..255, a bit symbol now contains the byte's
address in bit 0..7, and the bit position in bits 24..26.
Unfortunately, creating arrays of flags with a symbolic address is
not that simple any more: On an 8051, one simply wrote:
<PRE>

        segment bitdata                  

bit1    db      ?                        
bit2    db      ?                        

or

defbit  macro   name
name    bit     cnt
cnt     set     cnt+1
        endm   

</PRE>
On a 251, only the second way still works, like this:
<PRE>

adr     set     20h     ; start address of flags
bpos    set     0       ; in the internal RAM

defbit  macro   name
name    bit     adr.bpos
bpos    set     bpos+1
        if      bpos=8
bpos     set     0
adr      set     adr+1
        endif  
        endm

</PRE>
Another small detail: Intel now prefers<TT> CY</TT> instead of<TT>
C</TT> as a symbolic name for the carry, so you might have to rename
an already existing variable of the same name in your program.
However, AS will continue to understand also the old variant when
using the instructions<TT> CLR, CPL, SETB, MOV, ANL,</TT> or<TT>
ORL</TT>. The same is conceptually true for the additional
registers<TT> R8..R15, WR0..WR30, DR0..DR28, DR56, DR60, DPX,</TT>
and<TT> SPX</TT>.
<P>
Intel would like everyone to write absolute addresses in a syntax
of<TT> XX:YYYY</TT>, where<TT> XX</TT> is a 64K bank in the address
space resp. signifies addresses in the I/O space with an<TT> S</TT>.
As one might guess, I am not amused about this, which is why it is
legal to alternitavely use linear addresses in all places. Only
the<TT> S</TT> for I/O addresses is incircumventable, like in this
case:
<PRE>

Carry   bit     s:0d0h.7

</PRE>
Without the prefix, AS would assume an address in the<TT> CODE</TT>
segment, and only the first 128 bits in this space are
bit-addressable...
<P>
Like for the 8051, the generic branch instructions<TT> CALL</TT>
and<TT> JMP</TT> exist that automatically choose the shortest machine
code depending on the address layout. However, while<TT> JMP</TT>
also may use the variant with a 24-bit address,<TT> CALL</TT> will
not do this for a good reason: In contrast to<TT> ACALL</TT> and<TT>
LCALL</TT>,<TT> ECALL</TT> places an additional byte onto the stack.
A<TT> CALL</TT> instruction would result where you would not know
what it will do. This problem does not exist for the<TT> JMP</TT>
instructions.
<P>
There is one thing I did not understand: The 80251 is also able to
push immediate operands onto the stack, and it may push either single
bytes or complete words. However, the same mnemonic (<TT>PUSH</TT>)
is assigned to both variants - how on earth should an assembler know
if an instruction like
<PRE>

        push    #10

</PRE>
shall push a byte or a word containing the value 10? So the current
rule is that<TT> PUSH</TT> always pushes a byte; if one wants to push
a word, simply use<TT> PUSHW</TT> instead of<TT> PUSH</TT>.
<P>
Another well-meant advise: If you use the extended instruction set,
be sure to operate the processor in source mode; otherwise, all
instructions will become one byte longer! The old 8051 instructions
that will in turn become one byte longer are not a big matter: AS
will either replace them automatically with new, more general
instructions or they deal with obsolete addressing modes (indirect
addressing via 8 bit registers).
<P>

<P>
Similarly to the Z80 or 6502, Intel did not further specify the
undocumented 8085 instructions. This however means that other
assemblers might use different mnemonics for the same function.
Therefore, I will list the nistructions in the following. Once again,
usage of these instructions is at one's own risk - even the Z80 which
is principally upward compatible to the 8085 uses the opcodes for
entirely different functions...

<P>
Actually, I had sworn myself to keep the segment disease of Intel's
8086 out of the assembler. However, as there was a request and as
students are more flexible than the developers of this processor
obviously were, there is now a rudimentary support of these
processors in AS. When saying, 'rudimentary', it does not mean that
the instruction set is not fully covered. It means that the whole
pseudo instruction stuff that is available when using MASM, TASM, or
something equivalent does not exist. To put it in clear words, AS was
not primarily designed to write assembler programs for PC's (heaven
forbid, this really would have meant reinventing the wheel!);
instead, the development of programs for single-board computers was
the main goal (which may also be equipped with an 8086 CPU).
<P>
For die-hards who still want to write DOS programs with AS, here is a
small list of things to keep in mind:
<UL>
<LI> Only<TT> COM</TT> files may be created.</LI>
<LI> Only use the<TT> CODE</TT> segment, and place also all variables in
    this segment.</LI>
<LI> DOS initializes all segment registers to the code segment. An<TT>
    ASSUME DS:DATA, SS:DATA</TT> right at the program's beginning is
    therefore necessary.</LI>
<LI> DOS loads the code to a start address of 100h. An<TT> ORG</TT> to
    this address is absolutely necessary.</LI>
<LI> The conversion to a binary file is done with P2BIN (see later in
    this document), with an address filter of<TT> $-$</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
For these processors, AS only supports a small programming model,
i.e. there is<B> one</B> code segment with a maximum of 64 Kbytes and
a data segment of equal size for data (which cannot be set to initial
values for<TT> COM</TT> files). The<TT> SEGMENT</TT> instruction
allows to switch between these two segments. From this facts results
that branches are always intrasegment branches if they refer to
targets in this single code segment. In case that far jumps should be
necessary, they are possible via<TT> CALLF</TT> or<TT> JMPF</TT> with
a memory address or a<TT> Segment:Offset</TT> value as argument.
<P>
Another big problem of these processors is their assembler syntax,
which is sometimes ambiguous and whose exact meaning can then only be
deduced by looking at the current context. In the following example,
either absolute or immediate addressing may be meant, depending on
the symbol's type:
<PRE>

        mov     ax,value

</PRE>
When using AS, an expression without brackets always is interpreted
as immediate addressing. For example, when either a variable's
address or its contents shall be loaded, the differences listed in
table <A HREF="#ref_TabMASM">4.1</A> are present between MASM and AS:

<P><CENTER>Table 4.1: Differences AS<->MASM Concerning Addressing Syntax<A
           NAME="ref_TabMASM"></A>
</CENTER><P>

<P>
When addressing via a symbol, the assembler checks whether they are
assigned to the data segment and tries to automatically insert an
appropriate segment prefix. This happens for example when symbols
from the code segment are accessed without specifying a<TT> CS</TT>
segment prefix. However, this mechanism can only work if the<TT>
ASSUME</TT> instruction (see there) has previously been applied
correctly.
<P>
The Intel syntax also requires to store whether bytes or words were
stored at a symbol's address. AS will do this only when the<TT>
DB</TT> resp.<TT> DW</TT> instruction is in the same source line as
the label. For any other case, the operand size has to be specified
explicitly with the<TT> BYTE PTR, WORD PTR,...</TT> operators. As
long as a register is the other operator, this may be omitted, as the
operand size is then clearly given by the register's name.
<P>
In an 8086-based system, the coprocessor is usually synchronized via
via the processor's TEST input line which is connected to toe
coprocessor's BUSY output line. AS supports this type of handshaking
by automatically inserting a<TT> WAIT</TT> instruction prior to every
8087 instruction. If this is undesired for any reason, an<TT> N</TT>
has to be inserted after the<TT> F</TT> in the mnemonic; for example,
<PRE>

        FINIT            
        FSTSW   [vari]    

</PRE>
becomes
<PRE>

        FNINIT           
        FNSTSW  [vari]    

</PRE>
This variant is valid for<B> all</B> coprocessor instructions.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_17_">4.17. 8X30x</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_8X30xSpec"></A>
<P>
The processors of this family have been optimized for an easy
manipulation of bit groups at peripheral addresses. The
instructions<TT> LIV</TT> and<TT> RIV</TT> were introduced to deal
with such objects in a symbolic fashion. They work similar to<TT>
EQU</TT>, however they need three parameters:
<OL>
<LI>the address of the peripheral memory cell that contains the bit group
    (0..255);</LI>
<LI>the number of the group's first bit (0..7);</LI>
<LI>the length of the group, expressed in bits (1..8).</LI>
</OL>
<B> CAUTION!</B> The 8X30x does not support bit groups that span over
more than one memory address. Therefore, the valid value range for
the length can be stricter limited, depending on the start position.
AS does<B> not</B> perform any checks at this point, you simply get
strange results at runtime!
<P>
Regarding the machine code, length and position are expressed vis a 3
bit field in the instruction word and a proper register number
(<TT>LIVx</TT> resp.<TT> RIVx</TT>). If one uses a symbolic object,
AS will automatically assign correct values to this field, but it is
also allowed to specify the length explicitly as a third operand if
one does not work with symbolic objects. If AS finds such a length
specification in spite of a symbolic operand, it will compare both
lengths and issue an error if they do not match (the same will happen
for the MOVE instruction if two symbolic operands with different
lengths are used - the instruction simply only has a single length
field...).
<P>
Apart from the real machine instructions, AS defines similarly to its
''idol'' MCCAP some pseudo instructions that are implemented as
builtin macros:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>NOP</TT> is a shortform for<TT> MOVE AUX,AUX</TT></LI>
<LI> <TT>HALT</TT> is a shortform for<TT> JMP *</TT></LI>
<LI> <TT>XML ii</TT> is a shortform for<TT> XMIT ii,R12</TT> (only
    8X305)</LI>
<LI> <TT>XMR ii</TT> is a shortform for<TT> XMIT ii,R13</TT> (only
    8X305)</LI>
<LI> <TT>SEL &lt;busobj&gt;</TT> is a shortform for<TT> XMIT
    &lt;adr&gt;,IVL/IVR</TT>, i.e. it performs the necessary
    preselection to access &lt;busobj&gt;.</LI>
</UL>
The<TT> CALL</TT> and<TT> RTN</TT> instructions MCCAP also implements
are currently missing due to sufficient documentation. The same is
true for a set of pseudo instructions to store constants to memory.
Time may change this...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_18_">4.18. XA</A></H2>
<P>
Similar to its predecessor MCS/51, but in contrast to its
'competitor' MCS/251, the Philips XA has a separate address space for
bits, i.e. all bits that are accessible via bit instructions have a
certain, one-dimensional address which is stored as-is in the machine
code. However, I could not take the obvious opportunity to offer this
third address space (code and data are the other two) as a separate
segment. The reason is that - in contrast to the MCS/51 - some bit
addresses are ambiguous: bits with an address from 256 to 511 refer
to the bits of memory cells 20h..3fh in the current data segment.
This means that these addresses may correspond to different physical
bits, depending on the current state. Defining bits with the help
of<TT> DC</TT> instructions - something that would be possible with a
separate segment - would not make too much sense. However, the<TT>
BIT</TT> instruction still exists to define individual bits
(regardless if they are located in a register, the RAM or SFR space)
that can then be referenced symbolically. If the bit is located in
RAM, the address of the 64K-bank is also stored. This way, AS can
check whether the DS register has previously be assigned a correct
value with an<TT> ASSUME</TT> instruction.
<P>
In contrast, nothing can stop AS's efforts to align potential branch
targets to even addresses. Like other XA assemblers, AS does this by
inserting<TT> NOP</TT>s right before the instruction in question.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_19_">4.19. AVR</A></H2>
<P>
In contrast to the AVR assembler, AS by default uses the Intel format
to write hexadecimal contants instead of the C syntax. All right, I
did not look into the (free) AVR assembler before, but when I started
with the AVR part, there was hardly mor einformation about the AVR
than a preliminary manual describing processor types that were never
sold...this problem can be solved with a simple RELAXED ON.
<P>
Optionally, AS can generate so-called "object files" for the AVRs (it
also works for other CPUs, but it does not make any sense for
them...). These are files containing code and source line info what
e.g. allows a step-by-step execution on source level with the WAVRSIM
simulator delivered by Atmel. Unfortunately, the simulator seems to
have trouble with source file names longer than approx. 20
characters: Names are truncated and/or extended by strange special
characters when the maximum length is exceeded. AS therefore stores
file name specifications in object files without a path
specification. Therefore, problems may arise when files like includes
are not in the current directory.
<P>
A small specialty are machine instructions that have already been
defined by Atmel as part of the architecture, but up to now haven't
been implemented in any of the family's members. The instructions in
question are<TT> MUL, JMP,</TT> and<TT> CALL</TT>. Considering the
latter ones, one may ask himself how to reach the 4 Kwords large
address space of the AT90S8515 when the 'next best' instructions<TT>
RJMP</TT> and<TT> RCALL</TT> can only branch up to 2 Kwords forward
or backward. The trick is named 'discarding the upper address bits'
and described in detail with the<TT> WRAPMODE</TT> statement.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_20_">4.20. Z80UNDOC</A></H2>
<P>
As one might guess, Zilog did not make any syntax definitions for the
undocumented instructions; furthermore, not everyone might know the
full set. It might therefore make sense to list all instructions at
this place:
<P>
Similar to a Z380, it is possible to access the byte halves of IX and
IY separately. In detail, these are the instructions that allow this:
<PRE>

 INC Rx              LD R,Rx             LD  Rx,n
 DEC Rx              LD Rx,R             LD  Rx,Ry
 ADD/ADC/SUB/SBC/AND/XOR/OR/CP A,Rx 

</PRE>
<TT>Rx</TT> and<TT> Ry</TT> are synonyms for<TT> IXL, IXU, IYL</TT>
or<TT> IYU</TT>. Keep however in mind that in the case of<TT> LD
Rx,Ry</TT>, both registers must be part of the same index register.
<P>
The coding of shift instructions leaves an undefined bit combination
which is now accessible as the<TT> SLIA</TT> instruction.<TT>
SLIA</TT> works like<TT> SLA</TT> with the difference of entering a 1
into bit position 0. Like all other shift instructions,<TT> SLIA</TT>
also allows another undocumented variant:
<PRE>

        SLIA    R,(XY+d)                      

</PRE>
In this case,<TT> R</TT> is an arbitrary 8-bit register (excluding
index register halves...), and<TT> (XY+d)</TT> is a normal indexed
address. This operation has the additional effect of copying the
result into the register. This also works for the<TT> RES</TT>
and<TT> SET</TT> instructions:
<PRE>

        SET/RES R,n,(XY+d)                 

</PRE>
Furthermore, two hidden I/O instructions exist:
<PRE>

        IN      (C) resp. TSTI
        OUT     (C),0

</PRE>
Their operation should be clear.<B> CAUTION!</B> Noone can guarantee
that all mask revisions of the Z80 execute these instructions, and
the Z80's successors will react with traps if they find one of these
instructions. Use them on your own risk...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_21_">4.21. Z380</A></H2>
<P>
As this processor was designed as a grandchild of the still most
popular 8-bit microprocessor, it was a sine-qua-non design target to
execute existing Z80 programs without modification (of course, they
execute a bit faster, roughly by a factor of 10...). Therefore, all
extended features can be enabled after a reset by setting two bits
which are named XM (eXtended Mode, i.e. a 32-bit instead of a 16-bit
address space) respectively LW (long word mode, i.e. 32-bit instead
of 16-bit operands). One has to inform AS about their current setting
with the instructions<TT> EXTMODE</TT> resp.<TT> LWORDMODE</TT>, to
enable AS to check addresses and constants against the correct upper
limits. The toggle between 32- and 16-bit instruction of course only
influences instructions that are available in a 32-bit variant.
Unfortunately, the Z380 currently offers such variants only for load
and store instructions; arithmetic can only be done in 16 bits. Zilog
really should do something about this, otherwise the most positive
description for the Z380 would be ''16-bit processor with 32-bit
extensions''...
<P>
The whole thing becomes complicated by the ability to override the
operand size set by LW with the instruction prefixes<TT> DDIR W</TT>
resp.<TT> DDIR LW</TT>. AS will note the occurrence of such
instructions and will toggle setting for the instruction following
directly. By the way, one should never explicitly use other<TT>
DDIR</TT> variants than<TT> W</TT> resp.<TT> LW</TT>, as AS will
introduce them automatically when an operand is discovered that is
too long. Explicit usage might puzzle AS. The automatism is so
powerful that in a case like this:
<PRE>

        DDIR    LW
        LD      BC,12345678h   ,

</PRE>
the necessary<TT> IW</TT> prefix will automatically be merged into
the previous instruction, resulting in
<PRE>

        DDIR    LW,IW
        LD      BC,12345668h   .

</PRE>
The machine code that was first created for<TT> DDIR LW</TT> is
retracted and replaced, which is signified with an<TT> R</TT> in the
listing.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_22_">4.22. TLCS-900(L)</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_TLCS900Spec"></A>
<P>
These processors may run in two operating modes: on the one hand, in
minimum mode, which offers almost complete source code compatibility
to the Z80 and TLCS-90, and on the other hand in maximum mode, which
is necessary to make full use of the processor's capabilities. The
main differences between these two modes are:
<UL>
<LI> width of the registers WA, BC, DE, and HL: 16 or 32 bits;</LI>
<LI> number of register banks: 8 or 4;</LI>
<LI> code address space: 64 Kbytes or 16 Mbytes;</LI>
<LI> length of return addresses: 16 or 32 bits.</LI>
</UL>
To allow AS to check against the correct limits, one has to inform
him about the current execution mode via the<TT> MAXMODE</TT>
instruction (see there). The default is the minimum mode.
<P>
From this follows that, depending on the operating mode, the 16-bit
resp. 32-bit versions of the bank registers have to be used for
addressing, i.e. WA, BC, DE and HL for the minimum mode resp. XWA,
XBC, XDE and XHL for the maximum mode. The registers XIX..XIZ and XSP
are<B> always</B> 32 bits wide and therefore always have to to be
used in this form for addressing; in this detail, existing Z80 code
definitely has to be adapted (not including that there is no I/O
space and all I/O registers are memory-mapped...).
<P>
The syntax chosen by Toshiba is a bit unfortunate in the respect of
choosing an single quote (') to reference the previous register bank.
The processor independent parts of AS already use this character to
mark character constants. In an instruction like
<PRE>

        ld      wa',wa   ,

</PRE>
AS will not recognize the comma for parameter separation. This
problem can be circumvented by usage of an inverse single quote (`),
for example
<PRE>

        ld      wa`,wa                              

</PRE>
Toshiba delivers an own assembler for the TLCS-900 series (TAS900),
which is different from AS in the following points:
<P>

<H4>Symbol Conventions</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> TAS900 differentiates symbol names only on the first 32 characters.
    In contrast, AS always stores symbol names with the full length
    (up to 255 characters) and uses them all for
    differentiation.</LI>
<LI> TAS900 allows to write integer constants either in Intel or C
    notation (with a 0 prefix for octal or a 0x prefix for
    hexadecimal constants). By default, AS only supports the Intel
    notation. With the help of the<TT> RELAXED</TT> instruction, one
    also gets the C notation (among other).</LI>
<LI> AS does not distinguish between upper and lower case. In contrast,
    TAS900 differentiates between upper- and lowercase letters in
    symbol names. One needs to engage the<TT> -u</TT> command line
    option to force AS to do this.</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H4>Syntax</H4>
<P>
For many instructions, the syntax checking of AS is less strict than
the checking of TAS900. In some (rare) cases, the syntax is slightly
different. These extensions and changes are on the one hand for the
sake of a better portability of existing Z80 codes, on the other hand
they provide a simplification and better orthogonality of the
assembly syntax:
<UL>
<LI> In the case of<TT> LDA, JP</TT>, and<TT> CALL</TT>, TAS requires
    that address expressions like<TT> XIX+5</TT> must not be placed
    in parentheses, as it is usually the case. For the sake of better
    orthogonality, AS requires parentheses for<TT> LDA</TT>. They are
    optional if<TT> JP</TT> resp.<TT> CALL</TT> are used with a
    simple, absolute address.</LI>
<LI> In the case of<TT> JP, CALL, JR</TT>, and<TT> SCC</TT>, AS leaves
    the choice to the programmer whether to explicitly write out the
    default condition<TT> T</TT> (= true) as first parameter or not.
    TAS900 in contrast only allows to use the default condition
    implicitly (e.g.<TT> jp (xix+5)</TT> instead of<TT> jp
    t,(xix+5))</TT>.</LI>
<LI> For the<TT> EX</TT> instruction, AS allows operand combinations
    which are not listed in <A HREF="#cite_Tosh900">[106]</A> but can
    be reduced to a standard combination by swapping the operands.
    Combinations like<TT> EX f`,f</TT> or<TT> EX wa,(xhl)</TT> become
    possible. In contrast, TAS900 limits to the 'pure'
    combinations.</LI>
<LI> AS allows to omit an increment resp. decrement of 1 when using the
    instructions<TT> INC</TT> and<TT> DEC</TT>. TAS900 instead forces
    the programmer to explicit usage of '1'.</LI>
<LI> The similar is true for the shift instructions: If the operand is a
    register, TAS900 requires that even a shift count of 1 has to be
    written explicitly; however, when the operand is in memory, the
    hardware limits the shift count to 1 which must not be written in
    this case. With AS, a shift count of 1 is always optional and
    valid for all types of operands.</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H4>Macro Processor</H4>
<P>
The macro processor of TAS900 is an external program that operates
like a preprocessor. It consists of two components: The first one is
a C-like preprocessor, and the second one is a special macro language
(MPL) that reminds of high level languages. The macro processor of AS
instead is oriented towards ''classic'' macro assemblers like MASM or
M80 (both programs from Microsoft). It is a fixed component of AS.
<P>

<H4>Output Format</H4>
<P>
TAS900 generates relocatable code that allows to link separately
compiled programs to a single application. AS instead generates
absolute machine code that is not linkable. There are currently no
plans to extend AS in this respect.
<P>

<H4>Pseudo Instructions</H4>
<P>
Due to the missing linker, AS lacks a couple of pseudo instructions
needed for relocatable code TAS900 implements. The following
instructions are available with equal meaning:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT> EQU, DB, DW, ORG, ALIGN, END, TITLE, SAVE, RESTORE</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The latter two have an extended functionality for AS. Some TAS900
pseudo instructions can be replaced with equivalent AS instructions
(see table <A HREF="#ref_TabTAS900">4.2</A>).

           NAME="ref_TabTAS900"></A>
</CENTER><P>

Toshiba manufactures two versions of the processor core, with the L
version being an ''economy version''. AS will make the following
differences between TLCS-900 and TLCS-900L:
<UL>
<LI> The instructions<TT> MAX</TT> and<TT> NORMAL</TT> are not allowed
    for the L version; the<TT> MIN</TT> instruction is disabled for
    the full version.</LI>
<LI> The L version does not know the normal stack pointer XNSP/NSP, but
    instead has the interrupt nesting register INTNEST.</LI>
</UL>
The instructions<TT> SUPMODE</TT> and<TT> MAXMODE</TT> are not
influenced, just as their initial setting<TT> OFF</TT>. The
programmer has to take care of the fact that the L version starts in
maximum mode and does not have a normal mode. However, AS shows a bit
of mercy against the L variant by suppressing warnings for privileged
instructions.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_23_">4.23. TLCS-90</A></H2>
<P>
Maybe some people might ask themselves if I mixed up the order a
little bit, as Toshiba first released the TLCS-90 as an extended Z80
and afterwards the 16-bit version TLCS-900. Well, I discovered the
'90 via the '900 (thank you Oliver!). The two families are quite
similar, not only regarding their syntax but also in their
architecture. The hints for the '90 are therefore a subset of of the
chapter for the '900: As the '90 only allows shifts, increments, and
decrements by one, the count need not and must not be written as the
first argument. Once again, Toshiba wants to omit parentheses for
memory operands of<TT> LDA, JP, and CALL</TT>, and once again AS
requires them for the sake of orthogonality (the exact reason is of
course that this way, I saved an extra in the address parser, but one
does not say such a thing aloud).
<P>
Principally, the TLCS-90 series already has an address space of 1
Mbyte which is however only accessible as data space via the index
registers. AS therefore does not regard the bank registers and limits
the address space to 64 Kbytes. This should not limit too much as
this area above is anyway only reachable via indirect addressing.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_24_">4.24. TLCS-870</A></H2>
<P>
Once again Toshiba...a company quite productive at the moment!
Especially this branch of the family (all Toshiba microcontrollers
are quite similar in their binary coding and programming model) seems
to be targeted towards the 8051 market: the method of separating the
bit position from the address expression with a dot had its root in
the 8051. However, it creates now exactly the sort of problems I
anticipated when working on the 8051 part: On the one hand, the dot
is a legal part of symbol names, but on the other hand, it is part of
the address syntax. This means that AS has to separate address and
bit position and must process them independently. Currently, I solved
this conflict by seeking the dot starting at the<B> end</B> of the
expression. This way, the last dot is regarded as the separator, and
further dots stay parts of the address. I continue to urge everyone
to omit dots in symbol names, they will lead to ambiguities:
<PRE>

        LD      CF,A.7  ; accumulator bit 7 to carry
        LD      C,A.7   ; constant 'A.7' to accumulator

</PRE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_25_">4.25. TLCS-47</A></H2>
<P>
This family of 4-bit microcontrollers should mark the low end of what
is supportable by AS. Apart from the<TT> ASSUME</TT> instruction for
the data bank register (see there), there is only one thing that is
worth mentioning: In the data and I/O segment, nibbles are reserved
instead of byte (it's a 4-bitter...). The situation is similar to the
bit data segment of the 8051, where a<TT> DB</TT> reserves a single
bit, with the difference that we are dealing with nibbles.
<P>
Toshiba defined an ''extended instruction set'' for this processor
family to facilitate the work with their limited instruction set. In
the case of AS, it is defined in the include file<TT>
STDDEF47.INC</TT>. However, some instructions that could not be
realized as macros are ''builtins'' and are therefore also available
without the include file:
<UL>
<LI> the<TT> B</TT> instruction that automatically chooses the optimal
    version of the jump instruction (<TT>BSS; BS</TT>, or<TT>
    BSL</TT>);</LI>
<LI> <TT>LD</TT> in the variant of<TT> HL</TT> with an immediate
    operand;</LI>
<LI> <TT>ROLC</TT> and<TT> RORC</TT> with a shift amplitude higher than
    one.</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_26_">4.26. TLCS-9000</A></H2>
<P>
This is the first time that I implemented a processor for AS which
was not available at that point of time. Unfortunately, Toshiba
decided to put this processor ''on ice'', so we won't see any silicon
in the near future. This has of course the result that this part
<OL>
<LI>is a ''paper design'', i.e. there was so far no chance to test it in
    the reality and</LI>
<LI>the documentation for the '9000 I could get hold of <A
    HREF="#cite_Tosh9000">[109]</A> were preliminary, so they could
    not deliver clarity on every detail.</LI>
</OL>
Therefore, errors in this code generator are quite possible (and will
of course be fixed if it should ever become possible!). At least the
few examples listed in <A HREF="#cite_Tosh9000">[109]</A> are
assembled correctly.

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_27_">4.27. 29xxx</A></H2>

As it was already described in the discussion of the<TT> ASSUME</TT>
instruction, AS can use the information about the current setting of
the RBP register to detect accesses to privileged registers in user
mode. This ability is of course limited to direct accesses (i.e.
without using the registers IPA...IPC), and there is one more
pitfall: as local registers (registers with a number &gt;127) are
addressed relative to the stack pointer, but the bits in RBP always
refer to absolute numbers, the check is NOT done for local registers.
An extension would require AS to know always the absolute value of
SP, which would at least fail for recursive subroutines...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_28_">4.28. 80C16x</A></H2>
<P>
As it was already explained in the discussion of the<TT> ASSUME</TT>
instruction, AS tries to hide the fact that the processor has more
physical than logical RAM as far as possible. Please keep in mind
that the DPP registers are valid only for data accesses and only have
an influence on absolute addressing, neither on indirect nor on
indexed addresses. AS cannot know which value the computed address
may take at runtime... The paging unit unfortunately does not operate
for code accesses so one has to work with explicit long or short<TT>
CALL</TT>s,<TT> JMP</TT>s, or<TT> RET</TT>s. At least for the
''universal'' instructions<TT> CALL</TT> and<TT> JMP</TT>, AS will
automatically use the shortest variant, but at least for the RET one
should know where the call came from.<TT> JMPS</TT> and<TT>
CALLS</TT> principally require to write segment and address
separately, but AS is written in a way that it can split an address
on its own, e.g. one can write
<PRE>

        jmps    12345h

</PRE>
instead of
<PRE>

        jmps    1,2345h

</PRE>
Unfortunately, not all details of the chip's internal instruction
pipeline are hidden: if CP (register bank address), SP (stack), or
one of the paging registers are modified, their value is not
available for the instruction immediately following. AS tries to
detect such situations and will issue a warning in such cases. Once
again, this mechanism only works for direct accesses.
<P>
Bits defined with the<TT> BIT</TT> instruction are internally stored
as a 12-bit word, containing the address in bits 4..11 and the bit
position in the four LSBs. This order allows to refer the next resp.
previous bit by incrementing or decrementing the address. This will
however not work for explicit bit specifications when a word boundary
is crossed. For example, the following expression will result in a
range check error:
<PRE>

        bclr    r5.15+1

</PRE>
We need a<TT> BIT</TT> in this situation:
<PRE>

msb     bit     r5.15
        .
        .
        bclr    msb+1

</PRE>
The SFR area was doubled for the 80C167/165/163: bit 12 flags that a
bit lies in the second part. Siemens unfortunately did not foresee
that 256 SFRs (128 of them bit addressable) would not suffice for
successors of the 80C166. As a result, it would be impossible to
reach the second SFR area from F000H..F1DFH with short addresses or
bit instructions if the developers had not included a toggle
instruction:
<PRE>

        EXTR    #n

</PRE>
This instruction has the effect that for the next<TT> n</TT>
instructions (0&lt;n&lt;5), it is possible to address the alternate
SFR space instead of the normal one. AS does not only generate the
appropriate machine code when it encounters this instruction. It also
sets an internal flag that will only allow accesses to the alternate
SFR space for the next<TT> n</TT> instructions. Of course, they may
not contain jumps... Of course, it is always possible to define bits
from either area at any place, and it is always possible to reach all
registers with absolute addresses. In contrast, short and bit
addressing only works for one area at a time, attempts contradicting
to this will result in an error message.
<P>
The situation is similar for prefix instructions and absolute resp.
indirect addressing: as the prefix argument and the address
expression cannot always be evaluated at assembly time, chances for
checking are limited and AS will limit itself to warnings...in
detail, the situation is as follows:
<UL>
<LI> fixed specification of a 64K bank with<TT> EXTS</TT> or<TT>
    EXTSR</TT>: the address expression directly contains the lower 16
    bits of the target address. If the prefix and the following
    instruction have a constant operand, AS will check if the the
    prefix argument and bits 16..23 of the target address are
    equal.</LI>
<LI> fixed specification of a 16K page with<TT> EXTP</TT> or<TT>
    EXTPR</TT>: the address expression directly contains the lower 14
    bits of the target address. Bits 14 and 15 are fixed to 0, as the
    processor ignores them in this mode. If the prefix and the
    following instruction have a constant operand, AS will check if
    the the prefix argument and bits 14..23 of the target address are
    equal.</LI>
</UL>
An example to clarify things a bit (the DPP registers have their
reset values):
<PRE>

        extp    #7,#1      ; range from 112K..128K
        mov     r0,1cdefh  ; results in address 0defh in code
        mov     r0,1cdefh  ; --&gt;warning
        exts    #1,#1      ; range from 64K..128K
        mov     r0,1cdefh  ; results in address 0cdefh in code
        mov     r0,1cdefh  ; --&gt;warning

Similar to the MCS-48 family, the PICs split their program memory
into several banks because the opcode does not offer enough space for
a complete address. AS uses the same automatism for the
instructions<TT> CALL</TT> and<TT> GOTO</TT>, i.e. the PA bits in the
status word are set according to the start and target address.
However, this procedure is far more problematic compared to the 48's:
<OL>
<LI>The instructions are not any more one word long (up to three words).
    Therefore, it is not guaranteed that they can be skipped with a
    conditional branch.</LI>
<LI>It is possible that the program counter crosses a page boundary while
    the program sequence is executed. The setting of PA bits AS
    assumes may be different from reality.</LI>
</OL>
The instructions that operate on register W and another register
normally require a second parameter that specifies whether the result
shall be stored in W or the register. Under AS, it is valid to omit
the second parameter. The assumed target then depends upon the
operation's type: For unary operations, the result is by default
stored back into the register. These instructions are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT> COMF, DECF, DECFSZ, INCF, INCFSZ, RLF, RRF, and SWAPF</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The other operations by default regard W as an accumulator:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT> ADDWF, ANDWF, IORWF, MOVF, SUBWF, and XORWF</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The syntax defined by Microchip to write literals is quite obscure
and reminds of the syntax used on IBM 360/370 systems (greetings from
the stone-age...). To avoid introducing another branch into the
parser, with AS one has to write constants in the Motorola syntax
(optionally Intel or C in<TT> RELAXED</TT> mode).

With two exceptions, the same hints are valid as for its two smaller
brothers: the corresponding include file only contains register
definitions, and the problems concerning jump instructions are much
smaller. The only exception is the<TT> LCALL</TT> instruction, which
allows a jump with a 16-bit address. It is translated with the
following ''macro'':
<PRE>

        MOVLW   &lt;addr15..8&gt;   
        MOWF    3
        LCALL   &lt;addr0..7&gt;

These processors have the ability to map their code ROM pagewise into
the data area. I am not keen on repeating the whole discussion of
the<TT> ASSUME</TT> instruction at this place, so I refer to the
corresponding section (<A HREF="#ref_ST6Assume">3.2.15</A>) for an
explanation how to read constants out of the code ROM without too
much headache.

Some builtin ''macros'' show up when one analyzes the instruction set

In <A HREF="#cite_ST7Man">[81]</A>, the<TT> .w</TT> postfix to
signify 16-bit addresses is only defined for memory indirect
operands. It is used to mark that a 16-bit address is stored at a
zero page address. AS additionally allows this postfix for absolute
addresses or displacements of indirect address expressions to force
16-bit displacements in spite of an 8-bit value (0..255).

The ST9's bit addressing capabilities are quite limited: except for
the<TT> BTSET</TT> instruction, only bits within the current set of
working registers are accessible. A bit address is therefore of the
following style:
<PRE>

        rn.[!]b   ,

</PRE>
whereby<TT> !</TT> means an optional complement of a source operand.
If a bit is defined symbolically, the bit's register number is stored
in bits 7..4, the bit's position is stored in bits 3..1 and the
optional complement is kept in bit 0. AS distinguishes explicit and
symbolic bit addresses by the missing dot. A bit's symbolic name
therefore must not contain a dot, thought it would be legal in
respect to the general symbol name conventions. It is also valid to
invert a symbolically referred bit:
<PRE>

bit2    bit     r5.3  
        .
        .
        bld     r0.0,!bit2

</PRE>
This opportunity also allows to undo an inversion that was done at
definition of the symbol.
<P>
The include file<TT> REGST9.INC</TT> defines the symbolic names of
all on-chip registers and their associated bits. Keep however in mind
that the bit definitions only work after previously setting the
working register bank to the address of these peripheral registers!
<P>
In contrast to the definition file delivered with the AST9 assembler
from SGS-Thomson, the names of peripheral register names are only
defined as general registers (<TT>R...</TT>), not also as working
registers (<TT>r...</TT>). The reason for this is that AS does not
support register aliases; a tribute to assembly speed.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_34_">4.34. 6804</A></H2>
<P>
To be honest: I only implemented this processor in AS to quarrel
about SGS-Thomson's peculiar behaviour. When I first read the 6804's
data book, the ''incomplete'' instruction set and the built-in macros
immediately reminded me of the ST62 series manufactured by the same
company. A more thorough comparison of the opcodes gave surprising
insights: A 6804 opcode can be generated by taking the equivalent
ST62 opcode and mirroring all the bits! So Thomson obviously did a
bit of processor core recycling...which would be all right if they
would not try to hide this: different peripherals, motorola instead
of Zilog-style syntax, and the awful detail of<B> not</B> mirroring
operand fields in the opcode (e.g. bit fields containing
displacements). The last item is also the reason that finally
convinced me to support the 6804 in AS. I personally can only guess
which department at Thomson did the copy...
<P>
In contrast to its ST62 counterpart, the include file for the 6804
does not contain instruction macros that help a bit to deal with the
limited machine instruction set. This is left as an exercise to the
reader!

It seems that every semiconductor's ambition is to invent an own
notation for hexadecimal numbers. Texas Instrument took an especially
eccentric approach for these processors: a &gt; sign as prefix! The
support of such a format in AS would have lead to extreme conflicts
with AS's compare and shift operators. I therefore decided to use the
Intel notation, which is what TI also uses for the 340x0 series and
the 3201x's successors...
<P>
The instruction word of these processors unfortunately does not have
enough bits to store all 8 bits for direct addressing. This is why
the data address space is split into two banks of 128 words. AS
principally regards the data address space as a linear segment of 256
words and automatically clears bit 7 on direct accesses (an exception
is the<TT> SST</TT> instruction that can only write to the upper
bank). The programmer has to take care that the bank flag always has
the correct value!
<P>
Another hint that is well hidden in the data book: The<TT> SUBC</TT>
instruction internally needs more than one clock for completion, but
the control unit already continues to execute the next instruction.
An instruction following<TT> SUBC</TT> therefore may not access the
accumulator. AS does not check for such conditions!

As I did not write this code generator myself (that does not lower
its quality by any standard), I can only roughly line out why there
are some instructions that force a prefixed label to be untyped, i.e.
not assigned to any specific address space: The 2x series of TMS
signal processors has a code and a data segment which are both 64
Kbytes large. Depending on external circuitry, code and data space
may overlap, e.g. to allow storage of constants in the code area and
access them as data. Data storage in the code segment may be
necessary because older versions of AS assume that the data segment
only consists of RAM that cannot have a defined power-on state in a
single board system. They therefore reject storage of contents in
other segments than<TT> CODE</TT>. Without the feature of making
symbols untyped, AS would punish every access to a constant in code
space with a warning (''symbol out of wrong segment''). To say it in
detail, the following instructions make labels untyped:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT> BSS, STRING, RSTRING, BYTE, WORD , LONG<BR>
    FLOAT, DOUBLE, EFLOAT, BFLOAT and TFLOAT</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If one needs a typed label in front of one of these instructions, one
can work around this by placing the label in a separate line just
before the pseudo instruction itself. On the other hand, it is
possible to place an untyped label in front of another pseudo
instruction by defining the label with<TT> EQU</TT>, e.g.
<PRE>

&lt;name&gt;  EQU     $        .

</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_37_">4.37. TMS320C3x</A></H2>
<P>
The syntax detail that created the biggest amount of headache for me
while implementing this processor family is the splitting of parallel
instructions into two separate source code lines. Fortunately, both
instructions of such a construct are also valid single instructions.
AS therefore first generates the code for the first instruction and
replaces it by the parallel machine code when a parallel construct is
encountered in the second line. This operation can be noticed in the
assembly listing by the machine code address that does not advance
and the double dot replaced with a<TT> R</TT>.
<P>
Compared to the TI assembler, AS is not as flexible regarding the
position of the double lines that signify a parallel operation
(<TT>||</TT>): One either has to place them like a label (starting in
the first column) or to prepend them to the second mnemonic. The line
parser of AS will run into trouble if you do something else...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_38_">4.38. TMS9900</A></H2>
<P>
Similar to most older TI microprocessor families, TI used an own
format for hexadecimal and binary constants. AS instead favours the
Intel syntax which is also common for newer processor designs from
TI.
<P>
The TI syntax for registers allows to use a simple integer number
between 0 and 15 instead of a real name (<TT>Rx</TT> or<TT>
WRx</TT>). This has two consequences:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>R0...R15</TT> resp.<TT> WR0..WR15</TT> are simple predefined
    integer symbols with values from 0 to 15, and the definition of
    register aliases is a simple matter of<TT> EQU</TT>.</LI>
<LI> In contrast to several other processors, I cannot offer the
    additional AS feature that allows to omit the character sigifying
    absolute addressing (a @ sign in this case). As a missing
    character would mean register numbers (from 0 to 15) in this
    case, it was not possible to offer the optional omission.</LI>
</UL>
Furthermore, TI sometimes uses<TT> Rx</TT> to name registers and<TT>
WRx</TT> at other places...currently both variants are recognized by
AS.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_39_">4.39. TMS70Cxx</A></H2>
<P>
This processor family belongs to the older families developed by TI
and therefore TI's assemblers use their proprietary syntax for
hexadecimal resp. binary constants (a prefixed &lt; resp.<TT> ?</TT>
character). As this format could not be realized for AS, the Intel
syntax is used by default. This is the format TI to which also
switched over when introducing the successors, of this family, the
370 series of microcontrollers. Upon a closer inspection of both's
machine instruction set, one discovers that about 80% of all
instruction are binary upward compatible, and that also the assembly
syntax is almost identical - but unfortunately only almost. TI also
took the chance to make the syntax more orthogonal and simple. I
tried to introduce the majority of these changes also into the 7000's
instruction set:
<UL>
<LI> It is valid to use the more common<TT> #</TT> sign for immediate
    addressing instead of the percent sign.</LI>
<LI> If a port address (<TT>P...</TT>) is used as source or destination
    in a<TT> AND, BTJO, BTJZ, MOV, OR</TT>, or<TT> XOR</TT>
    instruction, it is not necessary to use the mnemonic variant with
    an appended<TT> P</TT> - the general form is sufficient.</LI>
<LI> The prefixed<TT> @</TT> sign for absolute or B-relative addressing
    may be omitted.</LI>
<LI> Instead of<TT> CMPA, CMP</TT> with<TT> A</TT> as target may be
    written.</LI>
<LI> Instead of<TT> LDA</TT> resp.<TT> STA</TT>, one can simply use
    the<TT> MOV</TT> instruction with<TT> A</TT> as source resp.
    destination.</LI>
<LI> One can write<TT> MOVW</TT> instead of<TT> MOVD</TT>.</LI>
<LI> It is valid to abbreviate<TT> RETS</TT> resp.<TT> RETI</TT> as<TT>
    RTS</TT> resp.<TT> RTI</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>TSTA</TT> resp.<TT> TSTB</TT> may be written as<TT> TST A</TT>
    resp.<TT> TST B</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>XCHB B</TT> is an alias for<TT> TSTB</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
An important note: these variants are only allowed for the TMS70Cxx -
the corresponding 7000 variants are not allowed for the 370 series!

Though these processors do not have specialized instructions for bit
manipulation, the assembler creates (with the help of the<TT>
DBIT</TT> instruction - see there) the illusion as if single bits
were addressable. To achieve this, the<TT> DBIT</TT> instructions
stores an address along with a bit position into an integer symbol
which may then be used as an argument to the pseudo instructions<TT>
SBIT0, SBIT1, CMPBIT, JBIT0</TT>, and<TT> JBIT1</TT>. These are
translated into the instructions<TT> OR, AND, XOR, BTJZ</TT>, and<TT>
BTJO</TT> with an appropriate bit mask.
<P>
There is nothing magic about these bit symbols, they are simple
integer values that contain the address in their lower and the bit
position in their upper half. One could construct bit symbols without
the<TT> DBIT</TT> instruction, like this:
<PRE>

defbit  macro   name,bit,addr
name    equ     addr+(bit&lt;&lt;16)
        endm

</PRE>
but this technique would not lead to the<TT> EQU</TT>-style syntax
defined by TI (the symbol to be defined replaces the label field in a
line).<B> CAUTION!</B> Though<TT> DBIT</TT> allows an arbitrary
address, the pseudo instructions can only operate with addresses
either in the range from 0..255 or 1000h..10ffh. The processor does
not have an absolute addressing mode for other memory ranges...

The MSP was designed to be a RISC processor with a minimal power
consumption. The set of machine instructions was therefore reduced to
the absolute minimum (RISC processors do not have a microcode ROM so
every additional instruction has to be implemented with additional
silicon that increases power consumption). A number of instructions
that are hardwired for other processors are therefore emulated with
other instructions. For AS, these instructions are defined in the
include file<TT> REGMSP.INC</TT>. You will get error messages for
more than half of the instructions defined by TI if you forget to
include this file!

National unfortunately also decided to use the syntax well known from
IBM mainframes (and much hated by me..) to write non-decimal integer
constants. Just like with other processors, this does not work with
AS's parser. ASMCOP however fortunately also seems to allow the C
syntax, which is why this became the default for the COP series and
the SC/MP...

Originally, National offered a relatively simple assembler for this
series of DECT controllers. An much more powerful assembler has been
announced by IAR, but it is not available up to now. However, since
the development tools made by IAR are as much target-independent as
possible, one can roughly estimate the pseudo instructions it will
support by looking at other available target platforms. With this in
mind, the (few) SC144xx-specific instructions<TT> DC, DC8, DW16, DS,
DS8, DS16, DW</TT> were designed. Of course, I didn't want to
reinvent the wheel for pseudo instructions whose functionality is
already part of the AS core. Therefore, here is a little table with
equivalences. The statements<TT> ALIGN, END, ENDM, EXITM, MACRO, ORG,
RADIX, SET,</TT> and<TT> REPT</TT> both exist for the IAR assembler
and AS and have same functionality. Changes are needed for the
following instructions:

Similar to other processors, the assembly language of the 75 series
also knows pseudo bit operands, i.e. it is possible to assign a
combination of address and bit number to a symbol that can then be
used as an argument for bit oriented instructions just like explicit
expressions. The following three instructions for example generate
the same code:
<PRE>

ADM     sfr     0fd8h
SOC     bit     ADM.3

        skt     0fd8h.3
        skt     ADM.3
        skt     SOC

</PRE>
AS distinguishes direct and symbolic bit accesses by the missing dot
in symbolic names; it is therefore forbidden to use dots in symbol
names to avoid misunderstandings in the parser.
<P>
The storage format of bit symbols mostly accepts the binary coding in
the machine instructions themselves: 16 bits are used, and there is a
''long'' and a ''short'' format. The short format can store the
following variants:
<UL>
<LI> direct accesses to the address range from 0FBxH to 0FFxH</LI>
<LI> indirect accesses in the style of<TT> Addr.@L</TT> (0FC0H <=<TT>
    Addr</TT> <=0FFFH)</LI>
<LI> indirect accesses in the style of<TT> @H+d4.bit</TT></LI>
</UL>
The upper byte is set to 0, the lower byte contains the bit
expression coded according to <A HREF="#cite_NEC75">[73]</A>. The
long format in contrast only knows direct addressing, but it can
cover the whole address space (given a correct setting of MBS and
MBE). A long expression stores bits 0..7 of the address in the lower
byte, the bit position in bits 8 and 9, and a constant value of 01 in
bits 10 and 11. The highest bits allow to distinguish easily between
long and short addresses via a check if the upper byte is 0. Bits
12..15 contain bits 8..11 of the address; they are not needed to
generate the code, but they have to be stored somewhere as the check
for correct banking can only take place when the symbol is actually
used.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_45_">4.45. 78K0</A></H2>

NEC uses different ways to mark absolute addressing in its data
books:
<UL>
<LI> absolute short: no prefix</LI>
<LI> absolute long: prefix of<TT> !</TT></LI>
<LI> PC relative: prefix of<TT> $</TT></LI>
</UL>
Under AS, these prefixes are only necessary if one wants to force a
certain addressing mode and the instruction allows different
variants. Without a prefix, AS will automatically select the shortest
variant. It should therefore rarely be necessary to use a prefix in
practice.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_46_">4.46. 78K2</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_78K2Spec"></A>
<P>
Analogous to the 78K0, NEC here also uses dollar signs and
exclamation marks to specify different lengths of address
expressions. The selection between long and short addresses is done
automatically (both in RAM and SFR areas), only relative addressing
has to be selected explicitly, if an instruction supports both
variants (like<TT> BR</TT>).
<P>
An additional remark (which is also true for the 78K0): Those who
want to use Motorola syntax via<TT> RELAXED</TT>, might have to put
hexadecimal constants in parentheses, since the leading dollar sign
might be misunderstood as relative addressing...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_47_">4.47. uPD772x</A></H2>
<P>
Both the 7720 and 7725 are provided by the same code generator and
are extremely similar in their instruction set. One should however
not beleive that they are binary compatible: To get space for the
longer address fields and additional instructions, the bit positions
of some fields in the instruction word have changed, and the
instruction length has changed from 23 to 24 bits. The code format
therefore uses different header ids for both CPUs.
<P>
They both have in common that in addition to the code and data
segment, there is also a ROM for storage of constants. In the case of
AS, it is mapped onto the<TT> ROMDATA</TT> segment!
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_4_48_">4.48. F2MC16L</A></H2>
<P>
Along with the discussion of the<TT> ASSUME</TT> statement, it has
already been mentioned that it is important to inform AS about the
correct current values of all bank registers - if your program uses
more than 64K RAM or 64K ROM. With these assumptions in mind, AS
checks every direct memory access for attempts to access a memory
location that is currently not in reach. Of course, standard
situations only require knowledge of DTB and DPR for this purpose,
since ADB resp. SSB/USB are only used for indirect accesses via
RW2/RW6 resp. RW3/RW7 and this mechanism anyway doesn't work for
indirect accesses. However, similar to the 8086, it is possible to
place a prefix in front of an instruction to replace DTB by a
different register. AS therefore keeps track of used segment prefixes
and toggles appropriately for the next<EM> machine instruction</EM>.
A pseudo instruction placed between the prefix and the machine
instruction does<EM> not</EM> reset the toggle. This is also true for
pseudo instructions that store data or modify the program counter.
Which doesn't make much sense anyway...
<P>

<H1><A NAME="sect_5_">5. File Formats</A></H1>
<P>
In this chapter, the formats of files AS generates shall be explained
whose formats are not self-explanatory.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_5_1_">5.1. Code Files</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_SectCodeFormat"></A>
<P>
The format for code files generated by the assembler must be able to
separate code parts that were generated for different target
processors; therefore, it is a bit different from most other formats.
Though the assembler package contains tools to deal with code files,
I think is a question of good style to describe the format in short:
<P>
If a code file contains multibyte values, they are stored in little
endian order. This rule is already valid for the 16-bit magic word
$1489, i.e. every code file starts with the byte sequence $89/$14.
<P>
This magic word is followed by an arbitrary number of ''records''. A
record may either contain a continuous piece of the code or certain
additional information. Even without switching to different processor
types, a file may contain several code-containing records, in case
that code or constant data areas are interrupted by reserved memory
areas that should not be initialized. This way, the assembler tries
to keep the file as short as possible.
<P>
Common to all records is a header byte which defines the record's
type and its contents. Written in a PASCALish way, the record
structure can be described in the following way:
<PRE>

FileRecord = RECORD CASE Header:Byte OF
              $00:(Creator:ARRAY[] OF Char);
              $01..
              $7f:(StartAdr : LongInt;
                   Length   : Word;
                   Data     : ARRAY[0..Length-1] OF Byte);
              $80:(EntryPoint:LongInt);
              $81:(Header   : Byte;
                   Segment  : Byte;
                   Gran     : Byte;
                   StartAdr : LongInt;
                   Length   : Word;
                   Data     : ARRAY[0..Length-1] OF Byte);
             END

</PRE>
This description does not express fully that the length of data
fields is variable and depends on the value of the<TT> Length</TT>
entries.
<P>
A record with a header byte of $81 is a record that may contain code
or data from arbitrary segments. The first byte (<TT>Header</TT>)
describes the processor family the following code resp. data was
generated for (see tables <A HREF="#ref_TabHeader">5.1</A> and <A
HREF="#ref_TabHeader2">5.2</A>).

</CENTER><P>

The<TT> Gran</TT> field describes the code's ''granularity'', i.e.
the size of the smallest addressable unit in the following set of
data. This value is a function of processor type and segment and is
an important parameter for the interpretation of the following two
fields that describe the block's start address and its length: While
the start address refers to the granularity, the<TT> Length</TT>
value is always expressed in bytes! For example, if the start address
is $300 and the length is 12, the resulting end address would be $30b
for a granularity of 1, however $303 for a granularity of 4!
Granularities that differ from 1 are rare and mostly appear in DSP
CPU's that are not designed for byte processing. For example, a
DSP56K's address space is organized in 64 Kwords of 16 bits. The
resulting storage capacity is 128 Kbytes, however it is organized as
2<SUP> 16</SUP> words that are addressed with addresses
0,1,2,...65535!
<P>
The start address is always 32 bits in size, independent of the
processor family. In contrast, the length specification has only 16
bits, i.e. a record may have a maximum length of 4+4+2+(64K-1) =
65545 bytes.
<P>
Data records with a Header ranging from $01 to $7f present a shortcut
and preserve backward compatibility to earlier definitions of the
file format: in their case, the Header directly defines the processor
type, the target segment is fixed to<TT> CODE</TT> and the
granularity is implicitly given by the processor type, rounded up to
the next power of two. AS prefers to use these records whenever data
or code should go into the<TT> CODE</TT> segment.
<P>
A record with a Header of $80 defines an entry point, i.e. the
address where execution of the program should start. Such a record is
the result of an<TT> END</TT> statement with a corresponding address
as argument.
<P>
The last record in a file bears the Header $00 and has only a string
as data field. This string does not have an explicit length
specification; its end is equal to the file's end. The string
contains only the name of the program that created the file and has
no further meaning.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_5_2_">5.2. Debug Files</A></H2>
<A NAME="ref_SectDebugFormat"></A>
<P>
Debug files may optionally be generated by AS. They deliver important
information for tools used after assembly, like disassemblers or
debuggers. AS can generate debug files in one of three formats: On
the one hand, the object format used by the AVR tools from Atmel
respectively a NoICE-compatible command file, and on the other hand
an own format. The first two are described in detail in <A
HREF="#cite_AVRObj">[4]</A> resp. the NoICE documentations, which is
why the following description limits itself to the AS-specific MAP
format:
<P>
The information in a MAP file is split into three groups:
<UL>
<LI> symbol table</LI>
<LI> memory usage per section</LI>
<LI> machine addresses of source lines</LI>
</UL>
The second item is listed first in the file. A single entry in this
list consists of two numbers that are separated by a<TT> :</TT>
character:
<PRE>

 &lt;line number&gt;:&lt;address&gt;

</PRE>
Such an entry states that the machine code generated for the source
statement in a certain line is stored at the mentioned address
(written in hexadecimal notation). With such an information, a
debugger can display the corresponding source lines while stepping
through a program. As a program may consist of several include files,
and due to the fact that a lot of processors have more than one
address space (though admittedly only one of them is used to store
executable code), the entries described above have to be sorted. AS
does this sorting in two levels: The primary sorting criteria is the
target segment, and the entries in one of these sections are sorted
according to files. The sections resp. subsections are separated by
special lines in the style of
<PRE>

Segment &lt;segment name&gt;

</PRE>
resp.
<PRE>

File &lt;file name&gt;   .

</PRE>
The source line info is followed by the symbol table. Similar to the
source line info, the symbol table is primarily sorted by the
segments individual symbols are assigned to. In contrast to the
source line info, an additional section<TT> NOTHING</TT> exists which
contains the symbols that are not assigned to any specific segment
(e.g. symbols that have been defined with a simple<TT> EQU</TT>
statement). A section in the symbol table is started with a line of
the following type:
<PRE>

Symbols in Segment &lt;segment name&gt;

</PRE>
The symbols in a section are sorted according to the alphabetical
order of their names, and one symbol entry consists of exactly one
line. Such a line consists of 5 fields witch are separated by at
least a single space:
<P>
The first field is the symbol's name, possibly extended by a section
number enclosed in brackets. Such a section number limits the range
of validity for a symbol. The second field designates the symbol's
type:<TT> Int</TT> stands for integer values,<TT> Float</TT> for
floating point numbers, and<TT> String</TT> for character arrays. The
third field finally contains the symbol's value. If the symbol
contains a string, it is necessary to use a special encoding for
control characters and spaces. Without such a coding, spaces in a
string could be misinterpreted as delimiters to the next field. AS
uses the same syntax that is also valid for assembly source files:
Instead of the character, its ASCII value with a leading backslash
(\) is inserted. For example, the string
<PRE>

 This is a test

</PRE>
becomes
<PRE>

 This\032is\032\a\032test   .

</PRE>
The numerical value always has three digits and has to be interpreted
as a decimal value. Naturally, the backslash itself also has to be
coded this way.
<P>
The fourth field specifies - if available - the size of the data
structure placed at the address given by the symbol. A debugger may
use this information to automatically display variables in their
correct length when they are referred symbolically. In case AS does
not have any information about the symbol size, this field simply
contains the value -1.
<P>
Finally,the fifth field states via the values 0 or 1 if the symbol
has been used during assembly. A program that reads the symbol table
can use this field to skip unused symbols as they are probably unused
during the following debugging/disassembly session.
<P>
The third section in a debug file describes the program's sections in
detail. The need for such a detailed description arises from the
sections' ability to limit the validity range of symbols. A symbolic
debugger for example cannot use certain symbols for a reverse
translation, depending on the current PC value. It may also have to
regard priorities for symbol usage when a value is represented by
more than one symbol. The definition of a section starts with a line
of the following form:
<PRE>

Info for Section nn ssss pp

</PRE>
<TT>nn</TT> specifies the section's number (the number that is also
used in the symbol table as a postfix for symbol names),<TT>
ssss</TT> gives its name and<TT> pp</TT> the number of its parent
section. The last information is needed by a retranslator to step
upward through a tree of sections until a fitting symbol is found.
This first line is followed by a number of further lines that
describe the code areas used by this section. Every single entry
(exactly one entry per line) either describes a single address or an
address range given by a lower and an upper bound (separation of
lower and upper bound by a minus sign). These bounds are
''inclusive'', i.e. the bounds themselves also belong to the area. Is
is important to note that an area belonging to a section is not
additionally listed for the section's parent sections (an exception
is of course a deliberate multiple allocation of address areas, but
you would not do this, would you?). On the one hand, this allows an
optimized storage of memory areas during assembly. On the other hand,
this should not be an obstacle for symbol backtranslation as the
single entry already gives an unambiguous entry point for the symbol
search path. The description of a section is ended by an empty line
or the end of the debug file.
<P>
Program parts that lie out of any section are not listed separately.
This implicit ''root section'' carries the number -1 and is also used
as parent section for sections that do not have a real parent
section.
<P>
It is possible that the file contains empty lines or comments (semi
colon at line start). A program reading the file has to ignore such
lines.
<P>

To simplify the work with the assembler's code format a bit, I added
some tools to aid processing of code files. These programs are

</CENTER><P>

Just like AS, all programs take their input from STDIN and write
messages to STDOUT (resp. error messages to STDERR). Therefore, input
and output redirections should not be a problem.
<P>
In case that numeric or address specifications have to be given in
the command line, they may also be written in hexadecimal notation
when they are prefixed with a dollar character or a<TT> 0x</TT> like
in C. (e.g. $10 or 0x10 instead of 16).
<P>
Unix shells however assign a special meaning to the dollar sign,         
which makes it necessary to escape a dollar sign with a backslash.
The<TT> 0x</TT> variant is definitely more comfortable in this case.
<P>
Otherwise, calling conventions and variations are equivalent to those
of AS (except for PLIST and AS2MSG); i.e. it is possible to store
frequently used parameters in an environment variable (whose name is
constructed by appending CMD to the program's name, i.e.<TT>
BINDCMD</TT> for BIND), to negate options, and to use all upper-
resp. lower-case writing (for details on this, see section <A
HREF="#ref_SectCallConvention">2.4</A>).
<P>
Address specifications always relate to the granularity of the
processor currently in question; for example, on a PIC, an address
difference of 1 means a word and not a byte.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_6_1_">6.1. PLIST</A></H2>
<P>
PLIST is the simplest one of the five programs supplied: its purpose
is simply to list all records that are stored in a code file. As the
program does not do very much, calling is quite simple:
<PRE>

    PLIST &lt;file name&gt;

</PRE>
The file name will automatically be extended with the extension<TT>
P</TT> if it doesn't already have one.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> At this place, no wildcards are allowed! If there is
a necessity to list several files with one command, use the following
''mini batch'':
<PRE>

    for %n in (*.p) do plist %n

</PRE>
PLIST prints the code file's contents in a table style, whereby
exactly one line will be printed per record. The individual rows have
the following meanings:
<UL>
<LI> code type: the processor family the code has been generated
    for.</LI>
<LI> start address: absolute memory address that expresses the load
    destination for the code.</LI>
<LI> length: length of this code chunk in bytes.</LI>
<LI> end address: last address of this code chunk. This address is
    calculated as start address+length-1.</LI>
</UL>
All outputs are in hexadecimal notation.
<P>
Finally, PLIST will print a copyright remark (if there is one in the
file), together with a summaric code length.
<P>
Simply said, PLIST is a sort of DIR for code files. One can use it to
examine a file's contents before one continues to process it.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_6_2_">6.2. BIND</A></H2>
<P>
BIND is a program that allows to concatenate the records of several
code files into a single file. A filter function is available that
can be used to copy only records of certain types. Used in this way,
BIND can also be used to split a code file into several files.
<P>
The general syntax of BIND is
<PRE>

   BIND &lt;source file(s)&gt; &lt;target file&gt; [options]

</PRE>
Just like AS, BIND regards all command line arguments that do not
start with a<TT> +, -</TT> or<TT> /</TT> as file specifications, of
which the last one must designate the destination file. All other
file specifications name sources, which may again contain wildcards.
<P>
Currently, BIND defines only one command line option:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>f &lt;Header[,Header]&gt;</TT>: sets a list of record headers
    that should be copied. Records with other header IDs will not be
    copied. Without such an option, all records will be copied. The
    headers given in the list correspond to the<TT> HeaderID</TT>
    field of the record structure described in section <A
    HREF="#ref_SectCodeFormat">5.1</A>. Individual headers in this
    list are separated with commas.</LI>
</UL>
For example, to filter all MCS-51 code out of a code file, use BIND
in the following way:
<PRE>

   BIND &lt;source name&gt; &lt;target name&gt; -f $31

</PRE>
If a file name misses an extension, the extension<TT> P</TT> will be
added automatically.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_6_3_">6.3. P2HEX</A></H2>
<P>
P2HEX is an extension of BIND. It has all command line options of
BIND and uses the same conventions for file names. In contrary to
BIND, the target file is written as a Hex file, i.e. as a sequence of
lines which represent the code as ASCII hex numbers.
<P>
P2HEX knows 8 different target formats, which can be selected via the
command line parameter<TT> F</TT>:
<UL>
<LI> Motorola S-Records<TT> (-F Moto)</TT></LI>
<LI> MOS Hex<TT> (-F MOS)</TT></LI>
<LI> Intel Hex (Intellec-8,<TT> -F Intel)</TT></LI>
<LI> 16-Bit Intel Hex (MCS-86,<TT> -F Intel16)</TT></LI>
<LI> 32-Bit Intel Hex<TT> (-F Intel32)</TT></LI>
<LI> Tektronix Hex<TT> (-F Tek)</TT></LI>
<LI> Texas Instruments DSK<TT> (-F DSK)</TT></LI>
<LI> Atmel AVR Generic (-F Atmel, see <A
    HREF="#cite_AVRObj">[4]</A>)</LI>
</UL>
If no target format is explicitly specified, P2HEX will automatically
choose one depending in the processor type: S-Records for Motorola
CPUs, Hitachi, and TLCS-900, MOS for 65xx/MELPS, DSK for the 16 bit
signal processors from Texas, Atmel Generic for the AVRs, and Intel
Hex for the rest. Depending on the start addresses width, the
S-Record format will use Records of type 1, 2, or 3, however, records
in one group will always be of the same type. This automatism can be
partially suppressed via the command line option
<PRE>

  -M &lt;1|2|3&gt;

</PRE>
A value of 2 resp. 3 assures that that S records with a minimum type
of 2 resp. 3 will be used, while a value of 1 corresponds to the full
automatism.
<P>
Normally, the AVR format always uses an address length of 3 bytes.
Some programs however do not like that...which is why there is a
switch
<PRE>

  -avrlen &lt;2|3&gt;

</PRE>
that allows to reduce the address length to two bytes in case of
emergency.
<P>
The Intel, MOS and Tektronix formats are limited to 16 bit addresses,
the 16-bit Intel format reaches 4 bits further. Addresses that are to
long for a given format will be reported by P2HEX with a warning;
afterwards, they will be truncated (!).
<P>
For the PIC microcontrollers, the switch
<PRE>

-m &lt;0..3&gt;

</PRE>
allows to generate the three different variants of the Intel Hex
format. Format 0 is INHX8M which contains all bytes in a Lo-Hi-Order.
Addresses become double as large because the PICs have a
word-oriented address space that increments addresses only by one per
word. This format is also the default. With Format 1 (INHX16M), bytes
are stored in their natural order. This is the format Microchip uses
for its own programming devices. Format 2 (INHX8L) resp. 3 (INHX8H)
split words into their lower resp. upper bytes. With these formats,
P2HEX has to be called twice to get the complete information, like in
the following example:
<PRE>

  p2hex test -m 2
  rename test.hex test.obl
  p2hex test -m 3
  rename test.hex test.obh

</PRE>
For the Motorola format, P2HEX additionally uses the S5 record type
mentioned in <A HREF="#cite_CPM68K">[8]</A>. This record contains the
number of data records (S1/S2/S3) to follow. As some programs might
not know how to deal with this record, one can suppress it with the
option
<PRE>

 +5  .

</PRE>
In case a source file contains code record for different processors,
the different hex formats will also show up in the target file - it
is therefore strongly advisable to use the filter function.
<P>
Apart form this filter function, P2HEX also supports an address
filter, which is useful to split the code into several parts (e.g.
for a set of EPROMs):
<PRE>

-r &lt;start address&gt;-&lt;end address&gt;

</PRE>
The start address is the first address in the window, and the end
address is the last address in the window,<B> not</B> the first
address that is out of the window. For example, to split an 8051
program into 4 2764 EPROMs, use the following commands:
<PRE>

p2hex &lt;source file&gt; eprom1 -f $31 -r $0000-$1fff
p2hex &lt;source file&gt; eprom2 -f $31 -r $2000-$3fff 
p2hex &lt;source file&gt; eprom3 -f $31 -r $4000-$5fff 
p2hex &lt;source file&gt; eprom4 -f $31 -r $6000-$7fff 

</PRE>
By default, the address window is 32 Kbytes large and starts at
address 0.
<P>
<B> CAUTION!</B> This type of splitting does not change the absolute
addresses that will be written into the files! If the addresses in
the individual hex files should rather start at 0, one can force this
with the additional switch
<PRE>

 -a     .

</PRE>
On the other hand, to move the addresses to a different location, one
may use the switch
<PRE>

 -R &lt;value&gt; .

</PRE>
The value given is an<EM> offset</EM>, i.e. it is added to the
addresses given in the code file.
<P>
A special value for start and stop address arguments is a single
dollar sign (<TT>$</TT>). This stands for the very first resp. last
address that has been used in the code file. So, if you want to be
sure that always the whole program is stored in the hex file, set the
address filter
<PRE>

 -r $-$

</PRE>
and you do not have to worry about address filters any more. Dollar
signs and fixed addresses may of course me mixed. For example, the
setting
<PRE>

 -r $-$7fff

</PRE>
limits the upper end to 32 Kbytes.
<P>
By using an offset, it is possible to move a file's contents to an
arbitrary position. This offset is simply appended to a file's name,
surrounded with parentheses. For example, if the code in a file
starts at address 0 and you want to move it to address 1000 hex in
the hex file, append<TT> ($1000)</TT> to the file's name (without
spaces!).
<P>
As the TI DSK format has the ability to distinguish between data and
code, there is a switch
<PRE>

 -d &lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;

</PRE>
to designate the address range that should be written as data instead
of code. For this option, single dollar signs are<B> not</B> allowed!
This option should not be used in new projects any more, since P2HEX
now can directly handle data in the DATA segment.
<P>
While this switch is only relevant for the DSK format, the option
<PRE>

 -e &lt;address&gt;

</PRE>
is also valid for the Intel and Motorola formats. Its purpose is to
set the entry address that will be inserted into the hex file. If
such a command line parameter is missing, P2HEX will search a
corresponding entry in the code file. If even this fails, no entry
address will be written to the hex file (DSK/Intel) or the field
reserved for the entry address will be set to 0 (Motorola).
<P>
Unfortunately, one finds different statements about the last line of
an Intel-Hex file in literature. Therefore, P2HEX knows three
different variants that may be selected via the command-line
parameter<TT> i</TT> and an additional number:
<PRE>

 0  :00000001FF
 1  :00000001
 2  :0000000000

</PRE>
By default, variant 0 is used which seems to be the most common one.
<P>
If the target file name does not have an extension, an extension
of<TT> HEX</TT> is supposed.
<P>
By default, P2HEX will print a maximum of 16 data bytes per line,
just as most other tools that output Hex files. If you want to change
this, you may use the switch
<PRE>

-l &lt;count&gt;   .

</PRE>
The allowed range of values goes from 2 to 254 data bytes; odd values
will implicitly be rounded down to an even count.
<P>
In most cases, the temporary code files generated by AS are not of
any further need after P2HEX has been run. The command line option
<PRE>

-k

</PRE>
allows to instruct P2HEX to erase them automatically after
conversion.
<P>
In contrast to BIND, P2HEX will not produce an empty target file if
only one file name (i.e. the target name) has been given. Instead,
P2HEX will use the corresponding code file. Therefore, a minimal call
in the style of
<PRE>

 P2HEX &lt;name&gt;

</PRE>
is possible, to generate<TT> &lt;name&gt;.hex</TT> out of<TT>
&lt;name&gt;.p</TT>.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_6_4_">6.4. P2BIN</A></H2>
<P>
P2BIN works similar to P2HEX and offers the same options (except for
the a and i options that do not make sense for binary files),
however, the result is stored as a simple binary file instead of a
hex file. Such a file is for example suitable for programming an
EPROM.
<P>
P2BIN knows three additional options to influence the resulting
binary file:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>l &lt;8 bit number&gt;</TT>: sets the value that should be used
    to fill unused memory areas. By default, the value $ff is used.
    This value assures that every half-way intelligent EPROM burner
    will skip these areas. This option allows to set different
    values, for example if you want to generate an image for the
    EPROM versions of MCS-48 microcontrollers (empty cells of their
    EPROM array contain zeroes, so $00 would be the correct value in
    this case).</LI>
<LI> <TT>s</TT>: commands the program to calculate a checksum of the
    binary file. This sum is printed as a 32-bit value, and the two's
    complement of the least significant bit will be stored in the
    file's last byte. This way, the modulus- 256-sum of the file will
    become zero.</LI>
<LI> <TT>m</TT>: is designed for the case that a CPU with a 16- or 32-bit
    data bus is used and the file has to be split for several EPROMs.
    The argument may have the following values:
<UL>
<LI>     <TT>ALL</TT>: copy everything</LI>
<LI>     <TT>ODD</TT>: copy all bytes with an odd address</LI>
<LI>     <TT>EVEN</TT>: copy all bytes with an even address</LI>
<LI>     <TT>BYTE0..BYTE3</TT>: copy only bytes with an address of 4n+0
        .. 4n+3</LI>
<LI>     <TT>WORD0, WORD1</TT>: copy only the lower resp. upper 16- bit
        word of a 32-bit word</LI>
</UL>
    </LI>
</UL>
To avoid confusions: If you use this option, the resulting binary
file will become smaller because only a part of the source will be
copied. Therefore, the resulting file will be smaller by a factor of
2 or 4 compared to<TT> ALL</TT>. This is just natural...
<P>
In case the code file does not contain an entry address, one may set
it via the<TT> -e</TT> command line option just like with P2HEX. Upon
request, P2BIN prepends the resulting image with this address. The
command line option
<PRE>

-S 

</PRE>
activates this function. It expects a numeric specification ranging
from 1 to 4 as parameter which specifies the length of the address
field in bytes. This number may optionally be prepended wit a<TT>
L</TT> or<TT> B</TT> letter to set the endian order of the address.
For example, the specification<TT> B4</TT> generates a 4 byte address
in big endian order, while a specification of<TT> L2</TT> or
simply<TT> 2</TT> creates a 2 byte address in little endian order.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_6_5_">6.5. AS2MSG</A></H2>
<P>
AS2MSG is not a tool in the real sense, it is a filter that was
designed to simplify the work with the assembler for (fortunate)
users of Borland Pascal 7.0. The DOS IDEs feature a 'tools' menu that
can be extended with own programs like AS. The filter allows to
directly display the error messages paired with a line specification
delivered by AS in the editor window. A new entry has to be added to
the tools menu to achieve this (Options/Tools/New). Enter the
following values:
<PRE>

 - Title: ~m~acro assembler
 - Program path: AS
 - Command line: 
      -E !1 $EDNAME $CAP MSG(AS2MSG) $NOSWAP $SAVE ALL
 - assign a hotkey if wanted (e.g. Shift-F7)

</PRE>
The -E option assures that Turbo Pascal will not become puzzled by
STDIN and STDERR.
<P>
I assume that AS and AS2MSG are located in a directory listed in
the<TT> PATH</TT> variable. After pressing the appropriate hotkey (or
selecting AS from the tools menu), as will be called with the name of
the file loaded in the active editor window as parameter. The error
messages generated during assembly are redirected to a special window
that allows to browse through the errors.<TT> Ctrl-Enter</TT> jumps
to an erroneous line. The window additionally contains the statistics
AS prints at the end of an assembly. These lines obtain the dummy
line number 1.
<P>
<TT> TURBO.EXE</TT> (Real Mode) and<TT> BP.EXE</TT> (Protected Mode)
may be used for this way of working with AS. I recommend however BP,
as this version does not have to 'swap' half of the DOS memory before
before AS is called.
<P>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="sect_A_">A. Error Messages of AS</A></H1>
<A NAME="ref_ChapErrMess"></A>
<P>
Here is a list of all error messages emitted by AS. Each error
message is described by:
<UL>
<LI> the internal error number (it is displayed only if AS is started
    with the<TT> -n</TT> option)</LI>
<LI> the text of the error message</LI>
<LI> error type:

<H1><A NAME="sect_C_">C. Frequently Asked Questions</A></H1>
<P>
In this chapter, I tried to collect some questions that arise very
often together with their answers. Answers to the problems presented
in this chapter might also be found at other places in this manual,
but one maybe does not find them immediately...
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Q:<DD>I am fed up with DOS. Are there versions of AS for other operating
    systems ?</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>Apart from the protected mode version that offers more memory when
    working under DOS, ports exist for OS/2 and Unix systems like
    Linux (currently in test phase). Versions that help operating
    system manufacturers located in Redmont to become even richer are
    currently not planned. I will gladly make the sources of AS
    available for someone else who wants to become active in this
    direction. The C variant is probably the best way to start a port
    into this direction. He should however not expect support from me
    that goes beyond the sources themselves...
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>Is a support of the XYZ processor planned for AS?</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>New processors are appearing all the time and I am trying to keep
    pace by extending AS. The stack on my desk labeled ''undone''
    however never goes below the 4 inch watermark... Wishes coming
    from users of course play an important role in the decision which
    candidates will be done first. The internet and the rising amount
    of documentation published in electronic form make the
    acquisition of data books easier than it used to be, but it
    always becomes difficult when more exotic or older architectures
    are wanted. If the processor family in question is not in the
    list of families that are planned (see chapter 1), adding a data
    book to a request will have a highly positive influence.
    Borrowing books is also fine.
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>Having a free assembler is really fine, but I now also had use for a
    disassembler...and a debugger...a simulator would also really be
    cool!</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>AS is a project I work on in leisure time, the time I have when I do
    not have to care of how to make my living. AS already takes a
    significant portion of that time, and sometimes I make a time-out
    to use my soldering iron, enjoy a Tangerine Dream CD, watch TV,
    or simply to fulfill some basic human needs... I once started to
    write the concept of a disassembler that was designed to create
    source code that can be assembled and that automatically
    separates code and data areas. I quickly stopped this project
    again when I realized that the remaining time simply did not
    suffice. I prefer to work on one good program than to struggle
    for half a dozen of mediocre apps. Regarded that way, the answer
    to the question is unfortunately ''no''...
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>The screen output of AS is messed up with strange characters, e.g.
    arrows and brackets. Why?</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>AS will by default use some ANSI control sequences for screen
    control. These sequences will appear unfiltered on your screen if
    you did not install an ANSI driver. Either install an ANSI driver
    or use the DOS command<TT> SET USEANSI=N</TT> to turn the
    sequences off.
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>AS suddenly terminates with a stack overflow error while assembling
    my program. Did my program become to large?</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>Yes and No. Your program's symbol table has grown a bit
    unsymmetrically what lead to high recursion depths while
    accessing the table. Errors of this type especially happen in the
    16-bit-OS/2 version of AS which has a very limited stack area.
    Restart AS with the<TT> -A</TT> command line switch. If this does
    not help, too complex formula expression are also a possible
    cause of stack overflows. In such a case, try to split the
    formula into intermediate steps.
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>It seems that AS does not assemble my program up to the end. It
    worked however with an older version of AS (1.39).</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>Newer versions of AS no longer ignore the<TT> END</TT> statement;
    they actually terminate assembly when an<TT> END</TT> is
    encountered. Especially older include files made by some users
    tended to contain an<TT> END</TT> statement at their end. Simply
    remove the superfluous<TT> END</TT> statements.
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>I made an assembly listing of my program because I had some more
    complicated assembly errors in my program. Upon closer
    investigation of the listing, I found that some branches do not
    point to the desired target but instead to themselves!</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>This effect happens in case of forward jumps in the first pass. The
    formula parser does not yet have the target address in its symbol
    table, and as it is a completely independent module, it has to
    think of a value that even does not hurt relative branches with
    short displacement lengths. This is the current program counter
    itself...in the second pass, the correct values would have
    appeared, but the second pass did not happen due to errors in the
    first one. Correct the other errors first so that AS gets into
    the second pass, and the listing should look more meaningful
    again.
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>Assembly of my program works perfectly, however I get an empty file
    when I try to convert it with P2HEX or P2BIN.</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>You probably did not set the address filter correctly. This filter by
    default cuts out an area ranging from 0 to 32 Kbytes. If you
    program contains memory chunks outside this range, they will be
    ignored. If your code is completely beyond the 32K barrier (this
    is commonplace for processors of the 65xx and 68xx series), you
    will get the result you just described. Simply set the address
    filter to a range that suits your needs (see the chapter dealing
    with P2BIN/P2HEX).
    </DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>I cannot enter the dollar character when using P2BIN or P2HEX under
    Unix. The automatic address range setting does not work, instead
    I get strange error messages.</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>Unix shells use the dollar character for expansion of shell
    variables. If you want to pass a dollar character to an
    application, prefix it with a backslash (\). In the special case
    of the address range specification for P2HEX and P2BIN, you may
    also use<TT> 0x</TT> instead of the dollar character, which
    removes this prblen completely.</DD>
<DT>Q:<DD>I use AS on a Linux system, the loader program for my target system
    however runs on a Windows machine. To simplify things, both
    systems access the same network drive. Unfortunately, the Windows
    side refuses to read the hex files created by the Linux side
    :-(</DD>
<DT>A:<DD>Windows and Linux systems use slightly different formats for text
    files (hex files are a sort of text files). Windows terminates
    every line with the characters CR (carriage return) and LF
    (linefeed), however Linux only uses the linefeed. It depends on
    the Windows program's 'goodwill' whether it will accept text
    files in the Linux format or not. If not, it is possible to
    transfer the files via FTP in ASCII mode instead of a network
    drive. Alternatively, the hex files can be converted to the
    Windows format. For example, the program<EM> unix2dos</EM> can be
    used to do this, or a small script under Linux:
<PRE>

          awk '{print $0"\r"}' test.hex &gt;test_cr.hex

</PRE>
    </DD>

<P><CENTER>Table E.3: Predefined Symbols - Part 3<A
           NAME="ref_TabInternSyms3"></A>
</CENTER><P>

<P>
To be exact, boolean symbols are just ordinary integer symbols with
the difference that AS will assign only two different values to them
(0 or 1, corresponding to False or True). AS does not store special
symbols in the symbol table. For performance reasons, they are
realized with hardcoded comparisons directly in the parser. They
therefore do not show up in the assembly listing's symbol table.
Predefined symbols are only set once at the beginning of a pass. The
values of dynamic symbols may in contrast change during assembly as
they reflect settings made with related pseudo instructions. The
values added in parentheses give the value present at the beginning
of a pass.
<P>
The names given in this table also reflect the valid way to reference
these symbols in case-sensitive mode.
<P>
The names listed here should be avoided for own symbols; either one
can define but not access them (special symbols), or one will receive
an error message due to a double-defined symbol. The ugliest case is
when the redefinition of a symbol made by AS at the beginning of a
pass leads to a phase error and an infinite loop...
<P>

<H1><A NAME="sect_F_">F. Shipped Include Files</A></H1>
<P>
The distribution of AS contains a couple of include files. Apart from
include files that only refer to a specific processor family (and
whose function should be immediately clear to someone who works with
this family), there are a few processor-independent files which
include useful functions. The functions defined in these files shall
be explained briefly in the following sections:
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_F_1_">F.1. BITFUNCS.INC</A></H2>
<P>
This file defines a couple of bit-oriented functions that might be
hardwired for other assemblers. In the case of AS however, thaey are
implemented with the help of user-defined functions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <EM> mask(start,bits)</EM> returns an integer with<EM> bits</EM>
    bits set starting at position<EM> start</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> invmask(start,bits)</EM> returns one's complement to<EM>
    mask()</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> cutout(x,start,bits)</EM> returns<EM> bits</EM> bits masked out
    from<EM> x</EM> starting at position<EM> start</EM> without
    shifting them to position 0;</LI>
<LI> <EM> hi(x)</EM> returns the second lowest byte (bits 8..15) of<EM>
    x</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> lo(x)</EM> returns the lowest byte (bits 8..15) of<EM>
    x</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> hiword(x)</EM> returns the second lowest word (bits 16..31)
    of<EM> x</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> loword(x)</EM> returns the lowest word (bits 0..15) of<EM>
    x</EM>;</LI>
<LI> <EM> odd(x)</EM> returns TRUE if<EM> x</EM> is odd;</LI>
<LI> <EM> even(x)</EM> returns TRUE if<EM> x</EM> is even;</LI>
<LI> <EM> getbit(x,n)</EM> extracts bit<EM> n</EM> out of<EM> x</EM> and
    returns it as 0 or 1;</LI>

<P>
If one decides to rewrite a chapter that has been out of date for two
years, it is almost unavoidable that one forgets to mention some of
the good ghosts who contributed to the success this project had up to
now. The first ''thank you'' therefore goes to the people whose names
I unwillingly forgot in the following enumeration!
<P>
The concept of AS as a universal cross assembler came from Bernhard
(C.) Zschocke who needed a ''student friendly'', i.e. free cross
assembler for his microprocessor course and talked me into extending
an already existing 68000 assembler. The rest is history... The
microprocessor course held at RWTH Aachen also always provided the
most engaged users (and bug-searchers) of new AS features and
therefore contributed a lot to today's quality of AS.
<P>
The internet and FTP have proved to be a big help for spreading AS
and reporting of bugs. My thanks therefore go to the FTP admins
(Bernd Casimir in Stuttgart, Norbert Breidor in Aachen, and
J&uuml;rgen Mei&szlig;burger in J&uuml;lich). Especially the last one
personally engaged a lot to establish a practicable way in
J&uuml;lich.
<P>
As we are just talking about the ZAM: Though Wolfgang E. Nagel is not
personally involved into AS, he is at least my boss and always puts
at least four eyes on what I am doing. Regarding AS, there seems to
be at least one that smiles...
<P>
A program like AS cannot be done without appropriate data books and
documentation. I received information from an enormous amount of
people, ranging from tips up to complete data books. An enumeration
follows (as stated before, without guarantee for completelessness!):
<P>
Ernst Ahlers, Charles Altmann, Marco Awater, Len Bayles, Andreas
Bolsch, Rolf Buchholz, Bernd Casimir, Gunther Ewald, Stephan
Hruschka, Peter Kliegelh&ouml;fer, Ulf Meinke, Matthias Paul, Norbert
Rosch, Steffen Schmid, Leonhard Schneider, Ernst Schwab, Michael
Schwingen, Oliver Sellke, Christian Stelter, Patrik Str&ouml;mdahl,
Oliver Thamm, Thorsten Thiele, Andreas Wassatsch, John Weinrich.
<P>
...and an ironic ''thank you'' to Rolf-Dieter-Klein and Tobias Thiel
who demonstrated with their ASM68K how one should<B> not</B> do it
and thereby indirectly gave me the impulse to write something better!
<P>
I did not entirely write AS on my own. AS contains the OverXMS
routines from Wilbert van Leijen which can move the overlay modules
into the extended memory. A really nice library, easy to use without
problems!
<P>
The TMS320C2x/5x code generators and the file<TT> STDDEF2x.INC</TT>
come from Thomas Sailer, ETH Zurich. It's surprising, he only needed
one weekend to understand my coding and to implement the new code
generator. Either that was a long nightshift or I am slowly getting
old...

<H1><A NAME="sect_I_">I. Hints for the AS Source Code</A></H1>
<A NAME="ref_ChapSource"></A>
<P>
As I already mentioned in the introduction, I release the source code
of AS on request. The following shall give a few hints to their
usage.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_1_">I.1. Language Preliminaries</A></H2>
<P>
In the beginning, AS was a program written in Turbo-Pascal. This was
roughly at the end of the eighties, and there were a couple of
reasons for this choice: First, I was much more used to it than to
any C compiler, and compared to Turbo Pascal's IDE, all DOS-based C
compilers were just crawling along. In the beginning of 1997 however,
it became clear that things had changed: One factor was that Borland
had decided to let its confident DOS developers down (once again,
explicitly no 'thank you', you boneheads from Borland!) and replaced
version 7.0 of Borland Pascal with something called 'Delphi', which
is probably a wonderful tool to develop Windows programs which
consist of 90% user interface and accidentaly a little bit of
content, however completely useless for command-line driven programs
like AS. Furthermore, my focus of operating systems had made a clear
move towards Unix, and I probably could have waited arbitrarily long
for a Borland Pascal for Linux (to all those remarking now that
Borland would be working on something like that: this is<EM>
Vapourware</EM>, don"t believe them anything until you can go into a
shop and actually buy it!). It was therefore clear that C was the way
to go.
<P>
After this eperience what results the usage of 'island systems' may
have, I put a big emphasize on portability while doing the
translation to C; however, since AS for example deals with binary
data in an exactly format and uses operating systen-specific
functions at some places which may need adaptions when one compliles
AS the first time for a new platform.
<P>
AS is tailored for a C compiler that conforms to the ANSI C standard;
C++ is explicitly not required. If you are still using a compiler
conforming to the outdated Kernighan&amp;Ritchie standard, you should
consider getting a newer compiler: The ANSI C standard has been fixed
in 1989 and there should be an ANSI C compiler for every contemporary
platform, maybe by using the old compiler to build GNU-C. Though
there are some switches in the source code to bring it nearer to
K&amp;R, this is not an officially supported feature which I only use
internally to support a quite antique Unix. Everything left to say
about K&amp;R is located in the file<TT> README.KR</TT>.
<P>
The inclusion of some additional features not present in the Pascal
version (e.g. dynamically loadable message files, test suite,
automatic generation of the documentation from<EM> one</EM> source
format) has made the source tree substantially more complicated. I
will attempt to unwire everything step by step:
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_2_">I.2. Capsuling System dependencies</A></H2>
<P>
As I already mentioned, As has been tailored to provide maximum
platform independence and portability (at least I believe so...).
This means packing all platform dependencies into as few files as
possible. I will describe these files now, and this section is the
first one because it is probably one of the most important:
<P>
The Build of all components of AS takes place via a central<TT>
Makefile</TT>. To make it work, it has to be accompanied by a
fitting<TT> Makefile.def</TT> that gives the platform dependent
settings like compiler flags. The subdirectory<TT>
Makefile.def-samples</TT> contains a couple of includes that work for
widespread platforms (but which need not be optimal...). In case your
platform is not among them, you may take the file<TT>
Makefile.def.tmpl</TT> as a starting point (and send me the result!).
<P>
A further component to capure system dependencies is the file<TT>
sysdefs.h</TT>. Practically all compilers predefine a couple of
preprocessor symbols that describe the target processor and the used
operating system. For example, on a Sun Sparc under Solaris equipped
with the GNU compiler, the symbols __sparc and __SVR4.<TT>
sysdefs.h</TT> exploits these symbols to provide a homogeneous
environment for the remaining, system-independent files. Especially,
this covers integer datatypes of a specific length, but it may also
include the (re)definition of C functions which are not present or
non-standard-like on a specific platform. It's best to read this
files yourself if you like to know which things may occur...
Generally, the #ifdef statement are ordered in two levels: First, a
specific processor platform is selected, the the operating systems
are sorted out in such a section.
<P>
If you port AS to a new platform, you have to find two symbols
typical for this platform and extend<TT> sysdefs.h</TT> accordingly.
Once again, I'm interested in the result...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_3_">I.3. System-Independent Files</A></H2>
<P>
...represent the largest part of all modules. Describing all
functions in detail is beyond the scope of this description (those
who want to know more probably start studying the sources, my
programming style isn't that horrible either...), which is why I can
only give a short list at this place with all modules their function:
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_I_3_1_">I.3.1. Modules Used by AS</A></H3>
<P>

<H4>as.c</H4>
<P>
This file is AS's root: it contains the<EM> main()</EM> function of
AS, the processing of all command line options, the overall control
of all passes and parts of the macro processor.
<P>

<H4>asmallg.c</H4>
<P>
This module processes all statements defined for all processor
targets, e.g.<TT> EQU</TT> and<TT> ORG</TT>. The<TT> CPU</TT>
pseudo-op used to switch among different processor targets is also
located here.
<P>

<H4>asmcode.c</H4>
<P>
This module contains the bookkeping needed for the code output file.
It exports an interface that allows to open and close a code file and
offers functions to write code to (or take it back from) the file. An
important job of this module is to buffer the write process, which
speeds up execution by writing the code in larger blocks.
<P>

<H4>asmdebug.c</H4>
<P>
AS can optionally generate debug information for other tools like
simulators or debuggers, allowing a backward reference to the source
code. They get collected in this module and can be output after
assembly in one of several formats.
<P>

<H4>asmdef.c</H4>
<P>
This modules only contains declarations of constants used in
different places and global variables.
<P>

<H4>asmfnums.c</H4>
<P>
AS assigns internally assigns incrementing numbers for each used
source file. These numbers are used for quick referencing. Assignment
of numbers and the conversion between names and numbers takes place
here.
<P>

<H4>asmif.c</H4>
<P>
Here ara ll routines located controlling conditional assembly. The
most important exported variable is a flag called<TT> IfAsm</TT>
which controls whether code generation is currently turned on or off.
<P>

<H4>asminclist.c</H4>
<P>
This module holds the definition of the list stucture that allows AS
to print the nesting of include files to the assembly list file.
<P>

<H4>asmitree.c</H4>
<P>
When searching for the mnemonic used in a line of code, a simple
linear comparison with all available machine instructions (as it is
still done in most code generators, for reasons of simplicity and
laziness) is not necessary the most effective method. This module
defines two improved structures (binary tree and hash table) which
provide a more efficient search and are destined to replace the
simple linear search on a step-by-step basis...priorities as
needed...
<P>

<H4>asmmac.c</H4>
<P>
Routines to store and execute macro constructs are located in this
module. The real macro processor is (as already mentioned) in<TT>
as.c</TT>.
<P>

<H4>asmpars.c</H4>
<P>
Here we really go into the innards: This module stores the symbol
tables (global and local) in two binary trees. Further more, there is
a quite large procedure<TT> EvalExpression</TT> which analyzes and
evaluates a (formula) expression. The procedure returns the result
(integer, floating point, or string) in a varaint record. However, to
evaluate expressions during code generation, one should better use
the functions<TT> EvalIntExpression, EvalFloatExpression</TT>,
and<TT> EvalStringExpression</TT>. Modifications for tha esake of
adding new target processors are unnecessary in this modules and
should be done with extreme care, since you are touching something
like 'AS's roots'.
<P>

<H4>asmsub.c</H4>
<P>
This module collects a couple of commonly used subroutines which
primarily deal with error handling and 'advanced' string processing.
<P>

<H4>bpemu.c</H4>
<P>
As already mentioned at the beginning, AS originally was a program
written in Borland Pascal. For some intrinsic functions of the
compiler, it was simpler to emulate those than to touch all places in
the source code where they are used. Well...
<P>

<H4>chunks.c</H4>
<P>
This module defines a data type to deal with a list of address
ranges. This functionality is needed by AS for allocation lists;
furthermore, P2BIN and P2HEX use such lists to warn about overlaps.
<P>

<H4>cmdarg.c</H4>
<P>
This module implements the overall mechanism of command line
arguments. It needs a specification of allowed arguments, splits the
command line and triggers the appropriate callbacks. In detail, the
mechanism includes the following:
<UL>
<LI> Processing of arguments located in an environment variable or a
    corresponding file;</LI>
<LI> Return of a set describing which command line arguments have not
    been processed;</LI>
<LI> A backdoor for situations when an overlaying IDE converts the passed
    command line completely into upper or lower case.</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H4>codepseudo.c</H4>
<P>
You will find at this place pseudo instructions that are used by a
subset of code generators. On the one hand, this is the Intel group
of<TT> DB..DT</TT>, and on the other hand their counterparts for 8/16
bit CPUs from Motorola or Rockwell. Someone who wants to extend AS by
a processor fitting into one of these groups can get the biggest part
of the necessary pseudo instructions with one call to this module.
<P>

<H4>codevars.c</H4>
<P>
For reasons of memory efficiency, some variables commonly used by
diverse code generators.
<P>

<H4>endian.c</H4>
<P>
Yet another bit of machine dependence, however one you do not have to
spend attention on: This module automatically checks at startup
whether a host machine is little or big endian. Furthermore, checks
are made if the type definitions made for integer variables in<TT>
sysdefs.h</TT> really result in the correct lengths.
<P>

<H4>headids.c</H4>
<P>
At this place, all processor families supported by AS are collected
with their header IDs (see chapter <A
HREF="#ref_SectCodeFormat">5.1</A>) and the output format to be used
by default by P2HEX. The target of this table is to centralize the
addition of a new processor as most as possible, i.e. in contrast to
earlier versions of AS, no further modifications of tool sources are
necessary.
<P>

<H4>ioerrs.c</H4>
<P>
The conversion from error numbers to clear text messages is located
here. I hope I'll never hit a system that does not define the numbers
as macros, because I would have to rewrite this module completely...
<P>

<H4>nlmessages.c</H4>
<P>
The C version of AS reads all messages from files at runtime after
the language to be used is clear. The format of message files is not
a simple one, but instead a special compact and preindexed format
that is generated at runtime by a program called 'rescomp' (we will
talk about it later). This module is the counterpart to rescomp that
reads the correct language part into a character field and offers
functions to access the messages.
<P>

<H4>nls.c</H4>
<P>
This module checks which country-dependent settings (date and time
format, country code) are present at runtime. Unfortunately, this is
a highly operating system-dependend task, and currently, there are
only three methods defines: The MS-DOS method, the OS/2 method and
the typical Unix method via<EM> locale</EM> functions. For all other
systems, there is unfortunately currently only NO_NLS available...
<P>

<H4>stdhandl.c</H4>
<P>
On the one hand, here is a special open function located knowing the
special strings<TT> !0...!2</TT> as file names and creating
duplicates of the standard file handles<EM> stdin, stdout,</EM>
and<EM> stderr</EM>. On the other hand, investiagations are done
whether the standard output has been redirected to a device or a
file. On no-Unix systems, this unfortunately also incorporates some
special operations.
<P>

<H4>stringlists.c</H4>
<P>
This is just a little 'hack' that defines routines to deal with
linear lists of strings, which are needed e.g. in the macro processor
of AS.
<P>

<H4>strutil.c</H4>
<P>
Some commonly needed string operations have found their home here.
<P>

<H4>version.c</H4>
<P>
The currently valid version is centrally stored here for AS and all
other tools.
<P>

<H4>code????.c</H4>
<P>
These modules form the main part of AS: each module contains the code
generator for a specific processor family.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_I_3_2_">I.3.2. Additional Modules for the Tools</A></H3>
<P>

<H4>hex.c</H4>
<P>
A small module to convert integer numbers to hexadecimal strings.
It's not absolutely needed in C any more (except for the conversion
of<EM> long long</EM> variables, which unfortunately not all<TT>
printf()</TT>'s support), but it somehow survived the porting from
Pascal to C.
<P>

<H4>p2bin.c</H4>
<P>
The sources of P2BIN.
<P>

<H4>p2hex.c</H4>
<P>
The sources of P2HEX.
<P>

<H4>pbind.c</H4>
<P>
The sources of BIND.
<P>

<H4>plist.c</H4>
<P>
The sources of PLIST.
<P>

<H4>toolutils.c</H4>
<P>
All subroutines needed by several tools are collected here, e.g. for
reading of code files.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_4_">I.4. Modules Needed During the Build of AS</A></H2>
<P>

<H4>a2k.c</H4>
<P>
This is a minimal filter converting ANSI C source files to
Kernighan-Ritchie style. To be exact: only function heads are
converted, even this only when they are roughly formatted like my
programming style. Noone should therefore think this were a universal
C parser!
<P>

<H4>addcr.c</H4>
<P>
A small filter needed during installation on DOS- or OS/2-systems.
Since DOS and OS/2 use a CR/LF for a newline, inc ontrast to the
single LF of Unix systems, all assembly include files provided with
AS are sent through this filter during assembly.
<P>

<H4>bincmp.c</H4>
<P>
For DOS and OS/2, this module takes the task of the<EM> cmp</EM>
command, i.e. the binary comparison of files during the test run.
While this would principally be possible with the<EM> comp</EM>
command provided with the OS,<EM> bincmp</EM> does not have any nasty
interactive questions (which seem to be an adventure to get rid
of...)
<P>

<H4>findhyphen.c</H4>
<P>
This is the submodule in<EM> tex2doc</EM> providing hyphenation of
words. The algorithm used for this is shamelessly stolen from TeX.
<P>

<H4>grhyph.c</H4>
<P>
The definition of hyphenation rules for the german language.
<P>

<H4>rescomp.c</H4>
<P>
This is AS's 'resource compiler', i.e. the tool that converts a
readable file with string resources into a fast, indexed format.
<P>

<H4>tex2doc.c</H4>
<P>
A tool that converts the LaTeX documentation of AS into an ASCII
format.
<P>

<H4>tex2html.c</H4>
<P>
A tool that converts the LaTeX documentation of AS into an HTML
document.
<P>

<H4>umlaut.c and unumlaut.c</H4>
<P>
These tiny programs convert national special characters between their
coding in ISO8859-1 (all AS files use this format upon delivery) and
their system-specific coding. Apart from a plain ASCII7 variant,
there are currently the IBM character sets 437 and 850.
<P>

<H4>ushyph.c</H4>
<P>
The definition of hyphenation rules for the english language.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_5_">I.5. Generation of Message Files</A></H2>
<P>
As already mentioned, the C source tree of AS uses a dynamic load
principle for all (error) messages. In contrast to the Pasacl sources
where all messages were bundled in an include file and compiled into
the programs, this method eliminates the need to provide AS in
multiple language variants; there is only one version which checks
for the langugage to be used upon runtime and loads the corresponding
component from the message files. Just to remind: Under DOS and OS/2,
the<TT> COUNTRY</TT> setting is queried, while under Unix, the
environment variables<TT> LC_MESSAGES, LC_ALL,</TT> and<TT> LANG</TT>
are checked.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="sect_I_5_1_">I.5.1. Format of the Source Files</A></H3>
<P>
A source file for the message compiler<EM> rescomp</EM> usually has
the suffix<TT> .res</TT>. The message compiler generates one or two
files from a source:
<UL>
<LI> a binary file which is read at runtime by AS resp. its tools</LI>
<LI> optionally one further C header file assigning an index number to
    all messages. These index numbers in combination with an index
    table in the binary file allow a fast access to to individual
    messages at runtime.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The source file for the message compiler is a pure ASCII file and can
therefore be modified with any editor. It consists of a sequence of
control commands with parameters. Empty lines and lines beginning
with a semicolon are ignored. Inclusion of other files is possible
via the<TT> Include</TT> statement:
<PRE>

Include &lt;Datei&gt; 

</PRE>
<P>
The first two statements in every source file must be two statements
describing the languages defined in the following. The more important
one is<TT> Langs</TT>, e.g.:
<PRE>

Langs DE(049) EN(001,061)

</PRE>
describes that two languages will be defined in the rest of the file.
The first one shall be used under Unix when the language has been set
to<TT> DE</TT> via environment variable. Similarly, It shall be used
under DOS and OS/2 when the country code was set to 049. Similarly,
the second set shall be used for the settings<TT> DE</TT> resp. 061
or 001. While multiple 'telephone numbers' may point to a single
language, the assignment to a Unix language code is a one-to-one
correspondence. This is no problem in practice since the<TT>
LANG</TT> variables Unix uses describe subversions via appendices,
e.g.:
<PRE>

de.de
de.ch
en.us

</PRE>
AS only compares the beginning of the strings and therefore still
comes to the right decision. The<TT> Default</TT> statement defines
the language that shall be used if either no language has been set at
all or a language is used that is not mentioned in the asrgument list
of<TT> Langs</TT>. This is typically the english language:
<PRE>

Default EN

</PRE>
These definitions are followed by an arbitrary number of<TT>
Message</TT> statements, i.e. definitions of messages:
<PRE>

Message ErrName 
 ": Fehler "    
 ": error "     

</PRE>
In case<EM> n</EM> languages were announced via the<TT> Langs</TT>
statement, the message compiler takes<B> exactly</B> the
following<EM> n</EM> as the strings to be stored. It is therefore
impossible to leave out certain languages for individual messages,
and an empty line following the strings should in no way be
misunderstood as an end marker for the list; inserted lines between
statements only serve purposes of better readability. It is however
allowed to split individual messages across multiple lines in the
source file; all lines except for the last one have to be ended with
a backslash as continuation character:
<PRE>

Message TestMessage2
 "Dies ist eine" \  
 "zweizeilige Nachricht"
 "This is a" \
 "two-line message"

</PRE>
As already mentioned, source files are pure ASCII files; national
special characters may be placed in message texts (and the compiler
will correctly pass them to the resulting file), a big disadvantage
however is that such a file is not fully portable any more: in case
it is ported to another system using a different coding for national
special characters, the user will probably be confronted with funny
characters at runtime...special characters should therefore always be
written via special sequences borrowed from HTML resp. SGML (see
table <A HREF="#ref_TabSpecChars">I.1</A>). Linefeeds can be inserted
into a line via \n, similar to C.

</CENTER><P>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_6_">I.6. Creation of Documentation</A></H2>
<P>
A source distribution of AS contains this documentation in LaTeX
format only. Other formats are created from this one automatically
via tools provided with AS. One reason is to reduce the size of the
source distribution, another reason is that changes in the
documentation only have to be made once, avoiding inconsistencies.
<P>
LaTex was chosen as the master format because...because...because
it's been there all the time before. Additionally, TeX is almost
arbitrarily portable and fits quite well to the demands of AS. A
standard distribution therefore allows a nice printout on about any
printer; for a conversion to an ASCII file that used to be part of
earlier distributions, the converter<EM> tex2doc</EM> is included,
additionally the converter<EM> tex2html</EM> allowing to put the
manual into the Web.
<P>
Generation of the documentation is started via a simple
<PRE>

make docs

</PRE>
The two converters mentioned are be built first, then applied to the
TeX documentation and finally, LaTeX itself is called. All this of
course for all languages...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_7_">I.7. Test Suite</A></H2>
<P>
Since AS deals with binary data of a precisely defined structure, it
is naturally sensitive for system and compiler dependencies. To reach
at least a minimum amount of secureness that everything went right
during compilation, a set of test sources is provided in the
subdirectory<TT> tests</TT> that allows to test the freshly built
assembler. These programs are primarily trimmed to find faults in the
translation of the machine instruction set, which are commonplace
when integer lenghts vary. Target-independent features like the macro
processors or conditional assembly are only casually tested, since I
assume that they work everywhere when they work for me...
<P>
The test run is started via a simple<EM> make test</EM>. Each test
program is assembled, converted to a binary file, and compared to a
reference image. A test is considered to be passed if and only if the
reference image and the newly generated one are identical on a
bit-by-bit basis. At the end of the test, the assembly time for every
test is printed (those who want may extend the file BENCHES with
these results), accompanied with a success or failure message. Track
down every error that occurs, even if it occurs in a processor target
you are never going to use! It is always possible that this points to
an error that may also come up for other targets, but by coincidence
not in the test cases.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_8_">I.8. Adding a New Target Processor</A></H2>
<P>
The probably most common reason to modify the source code of AS is to
add a new target processor. Apart from adding the new module to the
Makefile, there are few places in other modules that need a
modification. The new module will do the rest by registering itself
in the list of code generators. I will describe the needed steps in a
cookbook style in the following sections:
<P>

<H4>Choosing the Processor's Name</H4>
<P>
The name chosen for the new processor has to fulfill two criterias:
<OL>
<LI>The name must not be already in use by another processor. If one
    starts AS without any parameters, a list of the names already in
    use will be printed.</LI>
<LI>If the name shall appear completely in the symbol<TT> MOMCPU</TT>, it
    may not contain other letters than A..F (except right at the
    beginning). The variable<TT> MOMCPUNAME</TT> however will always
    report the full name during assembly. Special characters are
    generally disallowed, lowercase letters will be converted by
    the<TT> CPU</TT> command to uppercase letters and are therefore
    senseless in the processor name.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The first step for registration is making an entry for the new
processor (family) in the file<TT> headids.c</TT>. As already
mentioned, this file is also used by the tools and specifies the code
ID assigned to a processor family, along with the default hex file
format to be used. I would like to have some coordination before
choosing the ID...
<P>

<H4>Definition of the Code Generator Module</H4>
<P>
The unit's name that shall be responsible for the new processor
should bear at least some similarity to the processor's name (just
for the sake of uniformity) and should be named in the style of<TT>
code....</TT>. The head with include statements is best taken from
another existing code generator.
<P>
Except for an initialization function that has to be called at the
begginning of the<TT> main()</TT> function in module<TT> as.c</TT>,
the new module neither has to export variables nor functions as the
complete communication is done at runtime via indirect calls. They
are simply done by a call to the function<TT> AddCPU</TT> for each
processor type that shall be treated by this unit:
<PRE>

   CPUxxxx:=AddCPU('XXXX',SwitchTo_xxxx);

</PRE>
<TT>'XXXX'</TT> is the name chosen for the processor which later must
be used in assembler programs to switch AS to this target
processor.<TT> SwitchTo_xxxx</TT> (abbreviated as the ''switcher'' in
the following) is a procedure without parameters that is called by AS
when the switch to the new processor actually takes place.<TT>
AddCPU</TT> delivers an integer value as result that serves as an
internal ''handle'' for the new processor. The global variable<TT>
MomCPU</TT> always contains the handle of the target processor that
is currently set. The value returned by<TT> AddCPU</TT> should be
stored in a private variable of type<TT> CPUVar</TT> (called<TT>
CPUxxxx</TT> in the example above). In case a code generator module
implements more than one processor (e.g. several processors of a
family), the module can find out which instruction subset is
currently allowed by comparing<TT> MomCPU</TT> against the stored
handles.
<P>
The switcher's task is to ''reorganize'' AS for the new target
processor. This is done by changing the values of several global
variables:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>ValidSegs</TT>: Not all processors have all address spaces
    defined by AS. This set defines which subset the<TT> SEGMENT</TT>
    instruction will enable for the currently active target
    processor. At least the<TT> CODE</TT> segment has to be enabled.
    The complete set of allowed segments can be looked up the
    file<TT> fileformat.h</TT> (<TT>Seg....</TT> constants).</LI>
<LI> <TT>SegInits</TT>: This array stores the initial program counter
    values for the individual segments (i.e. the values the program
    counters will initially take when there is no<TT> ORG</TT>
    statement). There are only a few exceptions (like logically
    separated address spaces that physically overlap) which justify
    other initial values than 0.</LI>
<LI> <TT>Grans</TT>: This array specifies the size of the smallest
    addressable element in bytes for each segment, i.e. the size of
    an element that increases an address by 1. Most processors need a
    value of 1, even if they are 16- or 32-bit processors, but the
    PICs and signal processors are cases where higher values are
    required.</LI>
<LI> <TT>ListGrans</TT>: This array specifies the size of byte groups
    that shall be shown in the assembly listing. For example,
    instruction words of the 68000 are always 2 bytes long though the
    code segment's granularity is 1. The<TT> ListGran</TT> entry
    therefore has to be set to 2.</LI>
<LI> <TT>SegLimits</TT>: This array stores the highest possible address
    for each segment, e.g. 65535 for a 16-bit address space. This
    array need not be filled in case the code generator takes over
    the<TT> ChkPC</TT> method.</LI>
<LI> <TT>ConstMode</TT>: This variable may take the values<TT>
    ConstModeIntel</TT>,<TT> ConstModeMoto</TT>, or<TT>
    ConstModeC</TT> and rules which syntax has to be used to specify
    the base of integer constants.</LI>
<LI> <TT>PCSymbol</TT>: This variable contains the string an assembler
    program may use to to get the current value of the program
    counter. Intel processors for example usually use a dollar
    sign.</LI>
<LI> <TT>TurnWords</TT>: If the target processor uses big-endian
    addressing and one of the fields in<TT> ListGran</TT> is larger
    than one, set this flag to true to get the correct byte order in
    the code output file.</LI>
<LI> <TT>SetIsOccupied</TT>: Some processors have a<TT> SET</TT> machine
    instruction. AS will allow<TT> SET</TT> instructions to pass
    through to the code generator and instead use<TT> EVAL</TT> if
    this flag is set.</LI>
<LI> <TT>HeaderID</TT>: This variable contains the ID that is used to
    mark the current processor family in the the code output file
    (see the description of the code format described by AS). I urge
    to contact me before selecting the value to avoid ambiguities.
    Values outside the range of $01..$7f should be avoided as they
    are reserved for special purposes (like a future extension to
    allow linkable code). Even though this value is still hard-coded
    in most code generators, the preferred method is now to fetch
    this value from<TT> headids.h</TT> via<TT>
    FindFamilyByName</TT>.</LI>
<LI> <TT>NOPCode</TT>: There are some situations where AS has to fill
    unused code areas with NOP statements. This variable contains the
    machine code of the NOP statement.</LI>
<LI> <TT>DivideChars</TT>: This string contains the characters that are
    valid separation characters for instruction parameters. Only
    extreme exotics like the DSP56 require something else than a
    single comma in this string.</LI>
<LI> <TT>HasAttrs</TT>: Some processors like the 68k series additionally
    split an instruction into mnemonic and attribute. If the new
    processor also does something like that, set this flag to true
    and AS will deliver the instructions' components readily split in
    the string variables<TT> OpPart</TT> and<TT> AttrPart</TT>. If
    this flag is however set to false, no splitting will take place
    and the instruction will be delivered as a single piece in<TT>
    OpPart</TT>.<TT> AttrPart</TT> will stay empty in this case. One
    really should set this flag to false if the target processor does
    not have attributes as one otherwise looses the opportunity to
    use macros with a name containing dots (e.g. to emulate other
    assemblers).</LI>
<LI> <TT>AttrChars</TT>: In case<TT> HasAttrs</TT> is true, this string
    has to contain all characters that can separate mnemonic and
    attribute. In most cases, this string only contains a single
    dot.</LI>
</UL>
Do not assume that any of these variables has a predefined value; set
them<B> all</B>!!
<P>
Apart from these variables, some function pointers have to be set
that form the link form AS to the ''active'' parts of the code
generator:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>MakeCode</TT>: This routine is called after a source line has
    been split into mnemonic and parameters. The mnemonic is stored
    into the variable<TT> OpPart</TT>, and the parameters can be
    looked up in the array<TT> ArgStr</TT>. The number of arguments
    may be read from<TT> ArgCnt</TT>. The binary code has to be
    stored into the array<TT> BAsmCode</TT>, its length into<TT>
    CodeLen</TT>. In case the processor is word oriented like the
    68000 (i.e. the<TT> ListGran</TT> element corresponding to the
    currently active segment is 2), the field may be addressed
    wordwise via<TT> WAsmCode</TT>. There is also<TT> DAsmCode</TT>
    for extreme cases... The code length has to be given in units
    corresponding to the current segment's granularity.</LI>
<LI> <TT>SwitchFrom</TT>: This parameter-less procedure enables the code
    generator module to do ''cleanups'' when AS switches to another
    target processor. This hook allows e.g. to free memory that has
    been allocated in the generator and that is not needed as long as
    the generator is not active. It may point to an empty procedure
    in the simplest case. One example for the usage of this hook is
    the module<TT> CODE370</TT> that builds its instruction tables
    dynamically and frees them again after usage.</LI>
<LI> <TT>IsDef</TT>: Some processors know additional instructions that
    impose a special meaning on a label in the first row like<TT>
    EQU</TT> does. One example is the<TT> BIT</TT> instruction found
    in an 8051 environment. This function has to return TRUE if such
    a special instruction is present. In the simplest case (no such
    instructions), the routine may return a constant FALSE.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Optionally, the code generator may additionally set the following
function pointers:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>ChkPC</TT> : Though AS internally treats all program counters as
    either 32 or 64 bits, most processors use an address space that
    is much smaller. This function informs AS whether the current
    program counter has exceeded its allowed range. This routine may
    of course be much more complicated in case the target processor
    has more than one address space. One example is in module<TT>
    code16c8x.c</TT>. In case everything is fine, the function has to
    return TRUE, otherwise FALSE. The code generator only has to
    implement this function if it did not set up the array<TT>
    SegLimits</TT>. This may e.g. become necessary when the allowed
    range of addresses in a segment is non-continuous.</LI>
<LI> <TT>InternSymbol</TT> : Some processorcs, e.g. such with a register
    bank in their internal RAM, predefine such 'registers' as
    symbols, and it wouldn't make much sense to define them in a
    separate include file with 256 or maybe more<TT> EQU</TT>s. This
    hook allows access to the code generator of AS: It obtains an
    expression as an ASCII string and sets up the passed structure of
    type<EM> TempResult</EM> accordingly when one of these 'built-in'
    symbols is detected. The element<TT> Typ</TT> has to be set
    to<TT> TempNone</TT> in case the check failed. Errors messages
    from this routine should be avoided as unidentified names could
    signify ordinary symbols (the parser will check this afterwards).
    Be extreme careful with this routine as it allows you to
    intervene into the parser's heart!</LI>
</UL>
<P>
By the way: People who want to become immortal may add a copyright
string. This is done by adding a call to the procedure<TT>
AddCopyright</TT> in the module's initialization part (right next to
the<TT> AddCPU</TT> calls):
<PRE>

   AddCopyright(
      "Intel 80986 code generator (C) 2010 Jim Bonehead");

</PRE>
The string passed to<TT> AddCopyright</TT> will be printed upon
program start in addition to the standard message.
<P>
If needed, the unit may also use its initialization part to hook into
a list of procedures that are called prior to each pass of assembly.
Such a need for example arises when the module's code generation
depends on certain flags that can be modified via pseudo
instructions. An example is a processor that can operate in either
user or supervisor mode. In user mode, some instructions are
disabled. The flag that tells AS whether the following code executes
in user or supervisor mode might be set via a special pseudo
instruction. But there must also be an initialization that assures
that all passes start with the same state. The hook offered via<TT>
InitPassProc</TT> offers a chance to do such initializations. The
principle is similar to the redirection of an interrupt vector: the
unit saves the old value prior to pointing the procedure variable to
its own routine (the routine must be parameter-less and<TT> FAR</TT>
coded). The new routine first calls the old chain of procedures and
afterwards does its own operations.
<P>
The function chain built up via<TT> CleanUpProc</TT> works similar
to<TT> InitPassProc</TT>: It enables code generators to do clean-ups
after assembly (e.g. freeing of literal tables). This makes sense
when multiple files are assembled with a single call of AS.
Otherwise, one would risk to have 'junk' in tables from the previous
run. No module currently exploits this feature.
<P>

<H4>Writing the Code Generator itself</H4>
<P>
Now we finally reached the point where your creativity is challenged:
It is up to you how you manage to translate mnemonic and parameters
into a sequence of machine code. The symbol tables are of course
accessible (via the formula parser) just like everything exported
from<TT> ASMSUB</TT>. Some general rules (take them as advises and
not as laws...):
<UL>
<LI> Try to split the instruction set into groups of instructions that
    have the same operand syntax and that differ only in a few bits
    of their machine code. For example, one can do all instructions
    without parameters in a single table this way.</LI>
<LI> Most processors have a fixed spectrum of addressing modes. Place the
    parsing of an address expression in a separate routine so you an
    reuse the code.</LI>
<LI> The subroutine<TT> WrError</TT> defines a lot of possible error
    codes and can be easily extended. Use this! It is no good to
    simply issue a ''syntax error'' on all error conditions!</LI>
</UL>
Studying other existing code generators should also prove to be
helpful.
<P>

<H4>Modifications of Tools</H4>
<P>
A microscopic change to the tolls' sources is still necessary, namely
to the routine<TT> Granularity()</TT> in<TT> toolutils.c</TT>: in
case one of the processor's address spaces has a granularity
different to 1, the swich statement in this place has to be adapted
accordingly, otherwise PLIST, P2BIN, and P2HEX start counting
wrong...
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect_I_9_">I.9. Localization to a New Language</A></H2>
<P>
You are interested in this topic? Wonderful! This is an issue that is
often neglected by other programmers, especially when they come from
the country on the other side of the big lake...
<P>
The localization to a new language can be split into two parts: the
adaption of program messages and the translation of the manual. The
latter one is definitely a work of gigantic size, however, the
adaption of program messages should be a work doable on two or three
weekends, given that one knows both the new and one of the already
present messages. Unfortunately, this translation cannot be done on a
step-by-step basis because the resource compiler currently cannot
deal with a variable amount of languages for different messages, so
the slogan is 'all or nothing'.
<P>
The first oeration is to add the new language to<TT> header.res</TT>.
The two-letter-abbreviation used for this language is best fetched
from the nearest Unix system (in case you don't work on one
anyway...), the international telephone prefix from a DOS manual.
<P>
When this is complete, one can rebuild all necessary parts with a
simple<EM> make</EM> and obtains an assembler that supports one more
language. Do not forget to forward the results to me. This way, all
users will benefit from this with the next release :-)
<P>
