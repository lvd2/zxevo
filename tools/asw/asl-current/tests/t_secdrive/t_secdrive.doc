|   This is a MSDOS driver for a secondary MFM/RLL/ESDI/IDE controller I     |
|   wrote a few years ago - just to get another 40MB of storage (which was   |
|   a lot at that time...)                                                   |
|   This app also demonstrates the usage of the newly introduced structures. |
