+---------------------  Test Application PADDING ----------------------------+
|                                                                            |
| This test plays a bit with the new implementation of the PADDING option.   |
| A padding bit is no longer always inserted to make code length even, it is |
| inserted right when it is needed to put an instruction or (long) word data |
| on an even address.  This has some interesting implications for labels,    |
| which are demonstrated in this file.                                       |
|                                                                            |
