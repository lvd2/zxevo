+------------------------ Test Application 68KQ -----------------------------+

| Did I ever mention that the reason I started writing this assembler was    |
| another assembler with a broken implementation of MOVEQ?  So it's a bit    |
| embarrassing I f**ed up ADDQ/SUBQ with a recent rework.  Sadly, there      |
| is so far no systematic test for the 68K instruction set, the 68K target   |
| is simply from a time when I did not implement tests.  But at least, here  |
| is a small taet for the ...Q instructions...                               |
|                                                                            |
