+------------------------ Test Application MSPPAD ---------------------------+

| This tests 'plays' a bit with implicit padding inserted by the assembler,  |
| to advance the program counter to the next even address.  The important    |
| detail is that a label in the current or previous (empty) line also gets   |
| updated to this new address.  This requires a small state machine to keep  |
| track of the most recently defined label, that gets reset each time a      |
| padding was inserted right before the next machine instruction.  The state |
| machine should remain uninfluenced by pseudo statements like macros, which |
| does not always work - but the number of cases it works for is             |
| increasing...                                                              |
