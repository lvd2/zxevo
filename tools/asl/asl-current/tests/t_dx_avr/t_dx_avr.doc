+----------------------- Test Application DX_AVR ----------------------------+
|                                                                            |
|      This test plays a bit with the DB/DW/DD/DQ/DT pseudo instructions     |
|      on Atmel AVR.  This is special since the AVR's CODe segment is        |
|      organized in 16-bit words and is not byte-addressable.  Bytes are     |
|      packed in pairs, and a half-filled word remains if the number is odd. |
|                                                                            |
