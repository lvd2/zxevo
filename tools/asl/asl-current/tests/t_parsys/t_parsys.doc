| Back to the roots!  This is the "operating system" of my 68000-based par-  |
| allel computer I built several years ago and which was the main reason to  |
| write my own assembler because the original one from RDK was too buggy to  |
| work reliably with it.  Contains also a lot of FPU orders.                 |
